**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**
Yes. In one of the book tile, the complete description is not visible as that particular description is quite long and also due to the same size of all the tiles.

**Describe the solution you'd like**
Three things can be done:
1. The image of book can be reduced to maintain the uniform size of all book tiles
2. The spacing between the description can be reduced so they fit on in that space
3. Size of that book tile can be increased so as to make complete description visible

**Are you willing to contribute to this issue?** [Yes/No] 
Yes

**Describe alternatives you've considered**
