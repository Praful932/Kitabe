love story between a teenage girl and a vampire redefined romance for a
generation. Here's the book that started it all. Isabella Swan's move to
Forks, a small, perpetually rainy town in Washington, could have been the
most boring move she ever made. But once she meets the mysterious and
alluring Edward Cullen, Isabella's life takes a thrilling and terrifying
turn. Up until now, Edward has managed to keep his vampire identity a
secret in the small community he lives in, but now nobody is safe,
especially Isabella, the person Edward holds most dear. The lovers find
themselves balanced precariously on the point of a knife-between desire and
danger. Deeply romantic and extraordinarily suspenseful, Twilightcaptures
the struggle between defying our instincts and satisfying our desires. This
is a love story with bite. ""People do not want to just read Meyer's books;

3,3,"The unforgettable novel of a childhood in a sleepy Southern town and the
crisis of conscience that rocked it, To Kill A Mockingbird became both an
instant bestseller and a critical success when it was first published in
1960. It went on to win the Pulitzer Prize in 1961 and was later made into
an Academy Award-winning film, also a classic. Compassionate, dramatic, and
deeply moving, To Kill A Mockingbird takes readers to the roots of human
behavior - to innocence and experience, kindness and cruelty, love and
hatred, humor and pathos. Now with over 18 million copies in print and
translated into forty languages, this regional story by a young Alabama
woman claims universal appeal. Harper Lee always considered her book to be
a simple love story. Today it is regarded as a masterpiece of American

peek of Insurgent, an author Q&A, a discussion guide, a Divergent playlist,
faction manifestos, and more! In Beatrice Prior's dystopian Chicago world,
society is divided into five factions, each dedicated to the cultivation of
a particular virtue—Candor (the honest), Abnegation (the selfless),
Dauntless (the brave), Amity (the peaceful), and Erudite (the intelligent).
On an appointed day of every year, all sixteen-year-olds must select the
faction to which they will devote the rest of their lives. For Beatrice,
the decision is between staying with her family and being who she really
is—she can't have both. So she makes a choice that surprises everyone,
including herself. During the highly competitive initiation that follows,
Beatrice renames herself Tris and struggles alongside her fellow initiates
to live out the choice they have made. Together they must undergo extreme
physical tests of endurance and intense psychological simulations, some
with devastating consequences. As initiation transforms them all, Tris must
determine who her friends really are—and where, exactly, a romance with a
sometimes fascinating, sometimes exasperating boy fits into the life she's
chosen. But Tris also has a secret, one she's kept hidden from everyone
because she's been warned it can mean death. And as she discovers unrest
and growing conflict that threaten to unravel her seemingly perfect
society, she also learns that her secret might help her save those she
loves . . . or it might destroy her. Veronica Roth is the New York Times
bestselling author of Divergent, the first in a trilogy of dystopian
thrillers filled with electrifying decisions, heartbreaking betrayals,

dystopian tale One of Britain's most popular novels, George Orwell's
Nineteen Eighty-Four is set in a society terrorised by a totalitarian
ideology propagated by The Party. Winston Smith works for the Ministry of
Truth in London, chief city of Airstrip One. Big Brother stares out from
every poster, the Thought Police uncover every act of betrayal. When
Winston finds love with Julia, he discovers that life does not have to be
dull and deadening, and awakens to new possibilities. Despite the police
helicopters that hover and circle overhead, Winston and Julia begin to
question the Party; they are drawn towards conspiracy. Yet Big Brother will
not tolerate dissent - even in the mind. For those with original thoughts
they invented Room 101. . . Nineteen Eighty-Four is George Orwell's
terrifying vision of a totalitarian future in which everything and everyone
is slave to a tyrannical regime. The novel also coined many new words and
phrases which regular appear in popular culture, such as 'Big Brother',
'thoughtcrime', 'doublethink' and 'Newspeak'."

training as a wizard and his coming of age. He wants to get away from the
malicious Dursleys and go to the Quidditch World Cup with Hermione, Ron,
and the Weasleys. He wants to dream about his crush, Cho Chang (and maybe
do more than dream). And now that he’s gotten the hang of things at
Hogwarts—he hopes—he just wants to be a normal fourteen-year-old wizard.
But even by his standards, Harry's year is anything but normal. First
Dumbledore announces the revival of a grand competition that hasn't taken
place for one hundred years: the Triwizard Tournament, where a Hogwarts
champion will compete against rivals from two other schools of magic in
three highly dangerous tasks. Then someone frames Harry to participate in
the tournament—which really means someone wants him dead. Harry is guided
through the competition by Professor Alastor Moody, this year's Defense
Against the Dark Arts teacher, but he must also contend with a nasty
reporter named Rita Skeeter, who digs up some highly unflattering secrets
about Hagrid; a terrible fight with Ron, who is deeply jealous of Harry's
fame; Hermione's newfound activism on behalf of house-elves; and the
terrifying prospect of asking a date to the Yule Ball. Worst of all, Lord
Voldemort may finally have gathered the materials necessary for his
rejuvenation... and he has a faithful servant at Hogwarts waiting only for
a sign. No, nothing is ever normal for Harry Potter. And in his case,
different can be deadly."

epic tale of Harry Potter, Harry and Lord Voldemort each prepare for their
ultimate encounter. Voldemort takes control of the Ministry of Magic,
installs Severus Snape as headmaster at Hogwarts, and sends his Death
Eaters across the country to wreak havoc and find Harry. Meanwhile, Harry,
Ron, and Hermione embark on a desperate quest the length and breadth of
Britain, trying to locate and destroy Voldemort’s four remaining Horcruxes,
the magical objects in which he has hidden parts of his broken soul. They
visit the Burrow, Grimmauld Place, the Ministry, Godric’s Hollow, Malfoy
Manor, Diagon Alley…But every time they solve one mystery, three more
evolve—and not just about Voldemort, but about Dumbledore, and Harry’s own
past, and three mysterious objects called the Deathly Hallows. The Hallows
are literally things out of a children’s tale, which, if real, promise to
make their possessor the “Master of Death;” and they ensnare Harry with
their tantalizing claim of invulnerability. It is only after a nigh-
unbearable loss that he is brought back to his true purpose, and the trio
returns to Hogwarts for the final breathtaking battle between the forces of
good and evil. They fight the Death Eaters alongside members of the Order
of the Phoenix, Dumbledore’s Army, the Weasley clan, and the full array of
Hogwarts teachers and students. Yet everything turns upon the moment the
entire series has been building up to, the same meeting with which our
story began: the moment when Harry and Voldemort face each other at last."

the classic Hugo and Nebula award-winning science fiction novel of a young
boy's recruitment into the midst of an interstellar war. In order to
develop a secure defense against a hostile alien race's next attack,
government agencies breed child geniuses and train them as soldiers. A
brilliant young boy, Andrew ""Ender"" Wiggin lives with his kind but distant
parents, his sadistic brother Peter, and the person he loves more than
anyone else, his sister Valentine. Peter and Valentine were candidates for
the soldier-training program but didn't make the cut—young Ender is the
Wiggin drafted to the orbiting Battle School for rigorous military
training. Ender's skills make him a leader in school and respected in the
Battle Room, where children play at mock battles in zero gravity. Yet
growing up in an artificial community of young soldiers Ender suffers
greatly from isolation, rivalry from his peers, pressure from the adult
teachers, and an unsettling fear of the alien invaders. His psychological
battles include loneliness, fear that he is becoming like the cruel brother
he remembers, and fanning the flames of devotion to his beloved sister. Is
Ender the general Earth needs? But Ender is not the only result of the
genetic experiments. The war with the Buggers has been raging for a hundred
years, and the quest for the perfect general has been underway for almost
as long. Ender's two older siblings are every bit as unusual as he is, but
in very different ways. Between the three of them lie the abilities to
remake a world. If, that is, the world survives. Orson Scott Card's Ender's

“nothing short of spectacular” (Entertainment Weekly) memoir from one of
the world’s most gifted storytellers. The Glass Castle is a remarkable
memoir of resilience and redemption, and a revelatory look into a family at
once deeply dysfunctional and uniquely vibrant. When sober, Jeannette’s
brilliant and charismatic father captured his children’s imagination,
teaching them physics, geology, and how to embrace life fearlessly. But
when he drank, he was dishonest and destructive. Her mother was a free
spirit who abhorred the idea of domesticity and didn’t want the
responsibility of raising a family. The Walls children learned to take care
of themselves. They fed, clothed, and protected one another, and eventually
found their way to New York. Their parents followed them, choosing to be
homeless even as their children prospered. The Glass Castle is truly

in this star-crossed tale of ""young but everlasting love"" (Chicago Sun-
Times). There was a time when the world was sweeter....when the women in
Beaufort, North Carolina, wore dresses, and the men donned hats.... Every
April, when the wind smells of both the sea and lilacs, Landon Carter
remembers 1958, his last year at Beaufort High. Landon had dated a girl or
two, and even once sworn that he'd been in love. Certainly the last person
he thought he'd fall for was Jamie, the shy, almost ethereal daughter of
the town's Baptist minister....Jamie, who was destined to show him the
depths of the human heart-and the joy and pain of living. The inspiration
for this novel came from Nicholas Sparks's sister: her life and her
courage. From the internationally bestselling author Nicholas Sparks, comes
his most moving story yet...."

""Lolita"" through a broad range of interpretations. Although early criticism
of the text polarized around 'that' question - is it literature or
pornography? - the influence of American critics such as Lionel Trilling
quickly secured canonical status for the novel. A compelling aspect of
""Lolita"" criticism is the way in which that question continues to return in
different forms. In the 1980s and 1990s, ""Lolita"" has been the subject of
diverse critical attention, beyond 'Nabokov Studies': from Richard Rorty's
philosophical inquiry into the ethics of cruelty, to Rachel Bowlby's
feminist analysis of the rhetoric of consumer culture in the novel. All of
the main critical approaches to the novel are covered by this indispensable
sourcebook."
120,120,"Following the traditions of Gabriel GarcÍa Marquez, John Gardner and J.R.R.
Tolkien, Wicked is a richly woven tale that takes us to the other, darker
side of the rainbow as novelist Gregory Maguire chronicles the Wicked Witch
of the West's odyssey through the complex world of Oz -- where people call
you wicked if you tell the truth. Years before Dorothy and her dog crash-
land, another little girl makes her presence known in Oz. This girl,
Elphaba, is born with emerald-green skin -- no easy burden in a land as
mean and poor as Oz, where superstition and magic are not strong enough to
explain or to overcome the natural disasters of flood and famine. But
Elphaba is smart, and by the time she enters the university in Shiz, she
becomes a member of a charmed circle of Oz' most promising young citizens.
Elphaba's Oz is no utopia. The Wizard's secret police are everywhere.
Animals -- those creatures with voices, souls and minds -- are threatened
with exile. Young Elphaba, green and wild and misunderstood, is determined
to protect the Animals -- even it means combating the mysterious Wizard,
even if it means risking her single chance at romance. Even wiser in guilt
and sorrow, she can find herself grateful when the world declares her a
witch. And she can even make herself glad for that young girl from Kansas.
In Wicked, Gregory Maguire has taken the largely unknown world of Oz and
populated it with the power of his own imagination. Fast-paced,
fantastically real and supremely entertaining, this is a novel of vision
and re-vision. Oz never will be the same again."

survive because she no longer considered him a son, but a slave; and no
longer a boy, but an ""it."" Dave's bed was an old army cot in the basement,

luxury of food, it was nothing more than spoiled scraps that even the dogs

year at Merryweather High, Melinda knows this is a big fat lie, part of the
nonsense of high school. She is friendless, outcast, because she busted an
end-of-summer party by calling the cops, so now nobody will talk to her,
let alone listen to her. As time passes, she becomes increasingly isolated
and practically stops talking altogether. Only her art class offers any
solace, and it is through her work on an art project that she is finally
able to face what really happened at that terrible party: she was raped by
an upperclassman, a guy who still attends Merryweather and is still a
threat to her. Her healing process has just begun when she has another

be silent, and thereby achieves a measure of vindication. In Laurie Halse

Rowling, John Tiffany, and Jack Thorne, a play by Jack Thorne. It was
always difficult being Harry Potter and it isn't much easier now that he is
an overworked employee of the Ministry of Magic, a husband, and father of
three school-age children. While Harry grapples with a past that refuses to
stay where it belongs, his youngest son, Albus, must struggle with the
weight of a family legacy he never wanted. As past and present fuse
ominously, both father and son learn the uncomfortable truth: Sometimes,
darkness comes from unexpected places. The playscript for Harry Potter and

adulation of critics and readers with his mesmerizing tale of one woman's
painful yet triumphant journey of self-discovery. Now, this brilliantly
talented writer returns with I Know This Much Is True, a heartbreaking and
poignant multigenerational saga of the reproductive bonds of destruction
and the powerful force of forgiveness. A masterpiece that breathtakingly
tells a story of alienation and connection, power and abuse, devastation
and renewal--this novel is a contemporary retelling of an ancient Hindu
myth. A proud king must confront his demons to achieve salvation. Change
yourself, the myth instructs, and you will inhabit a renovated world. When
you're the same brother of a schizophrenic identical twin, the tricky thing
about saving yourself is the blood it leaves on your bands--the little
inconvenience of the look-alike corpse at your feet. And if you're into
both survival of the fittest and being your brother's keeper--if you've
promised your dying mother--then say so long to sleep and hello to the
middle of the night. Grab a book or a beer. Get used to Letterman's gap-
toothed smile of the absurd, or the view of the bedroom ceiling, or the
influence of random selection. Take it from a godless insomniac. Take it
from the uncrazy twin--the guy who beat the biochemical rap. Dominick
Birdsey's entire life has been compromised and constricted by anger and
fear, by the paranoid schizophrenic twin brother he both deeply loves and
resents, and by the past they shared with their adoptive father, Ray, a
spit-and-polish ex-Navy man (the five-foot-six-inch sleeping giant who
snoozed upstairs weekdays in the spare room and built submarines at night),
and their long-suffering mother, Concettina, a timid woman with a harelip
that made her shy and self-conscious: She holds a loose fist to her face to
cover her defective mouth--her perpetual apology to the world for a birth
defect over which she'd had no control. Born in the waning moments of 1949
and the opening minutes of 1950, the twins are physical mirror images who
grow into separate yet connected entities: the seemingly strong and
protective yet fearful Dominick, his mother's watchful ""monkey""; and the
seemingly weak and sweet yet noble Thomas, his mother's gentle ""bunny.""
From childhood, Dominick fights for both separation and wholeness--and
ultimately self-protection--in a house of fear dominated by Ray, a bully
who abuses his power over these stepsons whose biological father is a
mystery. I was still afraid of his anger but saw how he punished weakness--
pounced on it. Out of self-preservation I hid my fear, Dominick confesses.
As for Thomas, he just never knew how to play defense. He just didn't get
it. But Dominick's talent for survival comes at an enormous cost, including
the breakup of his marriage to the warm, beautiful Dessa, whom he still
loves. And it will be put to the ultimate test when Thomas, a Bible-
spouting zealot, commits an unthinkable act that threatens the tenuous
balance of both his and Dominick's lives. To save himself, Dominick must
confront not only the pain of his past but the dark secrets he has locked
deep within himself, and the sins of his ancestors--a quest that will lead
him beyond the confines of his blue-collar New England town to the volcanic
foothills of Sicily 's Mount Etna, where his ambitious and vengefully proud
grandfather and a namesake Domenico Tempesta, the sostegno del famiglia,
was born. Each of the stories Ma told us about Papa reinforced the message
that he was the boss, that he ruled the roost, that what he said went.
Searching for answers, Dominick turns to the whispers of the dead, to the
pages of his grandfather's handwritten memoir, The History of Domenico
Onofrio Tempesta, a Great Man from Humble Beginnings. Rendered with touches
of magic realism, Domenico's fablelike tale--in which monkeys enchant and
religious statues weep--becomes the old man's confession--an unwitting
legacy of contrition that reveals the truth's of Domenico's life, Dominick
learns that power, wrongly used, defeats the oppressor as well as the
oppressed, and now, picking through the humble shards of his deconstructed
life, he will search for the courage and love to forgive, to expiate his
and his ancestors' transgressions, and finally to rebuild himself beyond
the haunted shadow of his twin. Set against the vivid panoply of twentieth-
century America and filled with richly drawn, memorable characters, this
deeply moving and thoroughly satisfying novel brings to light humanity's
deepest needs and fears, our aloneness, our desire for love and acceptance,
our struggle to survive at all costs. Joyous, mystical, and exquisitely
written, I Know This Much Is True is an extraordinary reading experience
that will leave no reader untouched."

story of Robert Jordan, an antifascist American fighting in the Spanish
Civil War. In 1937 Ernest Hemingway traveled to Spain to cover the civil
war there for the North American Newspaper Alliance. Three years later he
completed the greatest novel to emerge from “the good fight,” and one of
the foremost classics of war literature in history. Published in 1940, For
Whom the Bell Tolls tells the story of Robert Jordan, a young American in
the International Brigades attached to an antifascist guerilla unit in the
mountains of Spain. In his portrayal of Jordan’s love for the beautiful
Maria and his superb account of El Sordo’s last stand, in his brilliant
travesty of La Pasionaria and his unwillingness to believe in blind faith,
Hemingway surpasses his achievement in The Sun Also Rises and A Farewell to
Arms to create a work at once rare and beautiful, strong and brutal,
compassionate, moving, and wise. “If the function of a writer is to reveal
reality,” Maxwell Perkins wrote Hemingway after reading the manuscript, “no
one ever so completely performed it.” Greater in power, broader in scope,
and more intensely emotional than any of the author’s previous works, For
Whom the Bell Tolls tells of loyalty and courage, love and defeat, and the
tragic death of an ideal. When it was first published, The New York Times
called it “a tremendous piece of work,” and it still stands today as one of
the best war novels of all time."

Japanese businessman. Roxanne Coss, opera's most revered soprano, has
mesmerized the international guests with her singing. It is a perfect

conditioning vents and takes the entire party hostage. But what begins as a
panicked, life-threatening scenario slowly evolves into something quite
different, as terrorists and hostages forge unexpected bonds and people
from different countries and continents become compatriots. Without the
demands of the world to shape their days, life on the inside becomes more
beautiful than anything they had known before. At once riveting and
impassioned, the narrative becomes a moving exploration of how people
communicate when music is the only common language. Friendship, compassion,
and the chance for great love lead the characters to forget the real danger
that has been set in motion and cannot be stopped. Ann Patchett has written
a novel that is as lyrical and profound as it is unforgettable. Bel Canto
engenders in the reader the very passion for art and the language of music
that its characters discover. As a reader, you find yourself fervently
wanting this captivity to continue forever, even though you know that real
life waits on the other side of the garden wall. A virtuoso performance by
one of our best and most important writers, Bel Canto is a novel to be

into wildly entertaining art,"" (The Christian Science Monitor) is elevated
to wilder and more entertaining heights than ever in this remarkable new
book. Trying to make coffee when the water is shut off, David considers
using the water in a vase of flowers and his chain of associations takes
him from the French countryside to a hilariously uncomfortable memory of
buying drugs in a mobile home in rural North Carolina. In essay after
essay, Sedaris proceeds from bizarre conundrums of daily life-having a
lozenge fall from your mouth into the lap of a fellow passenger on a plane
or armoring the windows with LP covers to protect the house from neurotic
songbirds-to the most deeply resonant human truths. Culminating in a
brilliant account of his venture to Tokyo in order to quit smoking, David
Sedaris's sixth essay collection is a new masterpiece of comic writing from
""a writer worth treasuring"" (Seattle Times). Praise for When You Are
Engulfed in Flames: ""Older, wiser, smarter and meaner, Sedaris...defies the
odds once again by delivering an intelligent take on the banalities of an
absurd life."" --Kirkus Reviews This latest collection proves that not only
does Sedaris still have it, but he's also getting better....Sedaris's best
stuff will still--after all this time--move, surprise, and entertain.""

abilities. Mare is a Red, scraping by as a thief in a poor, rural village,
until a twist of fate throws her in front of the Silver court. Before the
king, princes, and all the nobles, she discovers she has an ability of her
own. To cover up this impossibility, the king forces her to play the role
of a lost Silver princess and betroths her to one of his own sons. As Mare
is drawn further into the Silver world, she risks everything and uses her
new position to help the Scarlet Guard—a growing Red rebellion—even as her
heart tugs her in an impossible direction. One wrong move can lead to her

765,765,"When first published in 1899, ""The Awakening"" shocked readers with its
honest treatment of female marital infidelity. Audiences accustomed to the
pieties of late Victorian romantic fiction were taken aback by Chopin's
daring portrayal of a woman trapped in a stifling marriage, who seeks and
finds passionate physical love outside the straitened confines of her
domestic situation. Aside from its unusually frank treatment of a then-
controversial subject, the novel is widely admired today for its literary
qualities. Edmund Wilson characterized it as a work ""quite uninhibited and
beautifully written, which anticipates D. H. Lawrence in its treatment of
infidelity."" Although the theme of marital infidelity no longer shocks, few
novels have plumbed the psychology of a woman involved in an illicit
relationship with the perception, artistry, and honesty that Kate Chopin
brought to ""The Awakening."" Now available in this inexpensive edition, it
offers a powerful and provocative reading experience to modern readers.

792,792,"The astonishing novel Brave New World, originally published in 1932,
presents Aldous Huxley's vision of the future -- of a world utterly
transformed. Through the most efficient scientific and psychological
engineering, people are genetically designed to be passive and therefore
consistently useful to the ruling class. This powerful work of speculative
fiction sheds a blazing critical light on the present and is considered to
be Huxley's most enduring masterpiece. Following Brave New World is the
nonfiction work Brave New World Revisited, first published in 1958. It is a
fascinating work in which Huxley uses his tremendous knowledge of human
relations to compare the modern-day world with the prophetic fantasy
envisioned in Brave New World, including threats to humanity, such as
overpopulation, propaganda, and chemical persuasion."

IF YOU GOT A SECOND CHANCE AT LOVE, WOULD YOU MAKE THE SAME CALL? As far as
time machines go, a magic telephone is pretty useless. TV writer Georgie
McCool can't actually visit the past -- all she can do is call it, and hope
it picks up. And hope he picks up. Because once Georgie realizes she has a
magic phone that calls into the past, all she wants to do is make things
right with her husband, Neal. Maybe she can fix the things in their past
that seem unfixable in the present. Maybe this stupid phone is giving her a
chance to start over ... Does Georgie want to start over? From Rainbow
Rowell, the New York Times bestselling author of Eleanor & Park and
Fangirl, comes this heart-wrenching - and hilarious - take on fate, time,
television and true love. Landline asks if two people are ever truly on the

ever shrinking, they are convinced by their war leader, Eshonai, to risk
everything on a desperate gamble with the very supernatural forces they
once fled. The possible consequences for Parshendi and humans alike,
indeed, for Roshar itself, are as dangerous as they are incalculable. Other

891,891,"John Perry did two things on his 75th birthday. First he visited his wife’s
grave. Then he joined the army. The good news is that humanity finally made
it into interstellar space. The bad news is that planets fit to live on are
scarce—and alien races willing to fight us for them are common. So: we
fight. To defend Earth, and to stake our own claim to planetary real
estate. Far from Earth, the war has been going on for decades: brutal,
bloody, unyielding. Earth itself is a backwater. The bulk of humanity’s
resources are in the hands of the Colonial Defense Force. Everybody knows
that when you reach retirement age, you can join the CDF. They don’t want
young people; they want people who carry the knowledge and skills of
decades of living. You’ll be taken off Earth and never allowed to return.
You’ll serve two years at the front. And if you survive, you’ll be given a
generous homestead stake of your own, on one of our hard-won colony
planets. John Perry is taking that deal. He has only the vaguest idea what
to expect. Because the actual fight, light-years from home, is far, far
harder than he can imagine—and what he will become is far stranger. ""Solid
. . . [Scalzi] sidesteps most of the clichés of military science fiction,
delivers fast-paced scenes of combat and pays attention to the science
underpinning his premise."" —San Francisco Chronicle ""Scalzi's imagined
interstellar arena is coherently and compellingly delineated . . . His
speculative elements are top-notch. His combat scenes are blood-roiling.
His dialogue is suitably snappy and profane. And the moral and
philosophical issues he raises . . . insert useful ethical burrs under the
military saddle of the story."" —Paul Di Filippo, The Washington Post
""Thought-provoking!"" —Entertainment Weekly ""Smartly conceived and
thoroughly entertaining, Old Man’s War is a splendid novel."" –Cleveland
Plain Dealer ""When humanity reaches the stars, it discovers that it must
defend its claim to new planets against alien races with similar
expansionist tendencies. To ensure the expertise of its soldiers, Earth
creates the Colonial Defense Force, an army of men and women otherwise
classified as senior citizens, who give up their lives on Earth for an
uncertain and perilous future among the stars. Scalzi's first novel
presents a new approach to military sf, boasting an unusual cast of senior
citizens as heroes. A good choice for most libraries."" —Library Journal
""Though a lot of SF writers are more or less efficiently continuing the
tradition of Robert A. Heinlein, Scalzi’s astonishingly proficient first
novel reads like an original work by the late grand master . . . This
virtuoso debut pays tribute to SF’s past while showing that well-worn
tropes still can have real zip when they’re approached with ingenuity.""
—Publishers Weekly (starred review) ""Gripping and surpassingly original.
It's Starship Troopers without the lectures. It's The Forever War with
better sex. It's funny, it's sad, and it's true."" —Cory Doctorow ""John
Scalzi is a fresh and appealing new voice, and Old Man's War is classic SF
seen from a modern perspective—a fast-paced tour of a daunting, hostile
universe."" —Robert Charles Wilson ""I enjoyed Old Man's War immensely. A
space war story with fast action, vivid characters, moral complexity and
cool speculative physics, set in a future you almost want to live into, and
a universe you sincerely hope you don't live in already."" —Ken MacLeod"

seduction between a husband and wife ends in death, the nightmare has only
begun… “And now the voice which spoke belonged to no one but herself. Oh my
God, it said. Oh my God, I am all alone out here. I am all alone.” Once
again, Jessie Burlingame has been talked into submitting to her husband
Gerald’s kinky sex games—something that she’s frankly had enough of, and
they never held much charm for her to begin with. So much for a “romantic
getaway” at their secluded summer home. After Jessie is handcuffed to the
bedposts—and Gerald crosses a line with his wife—the day ends with deadly
consequences. Now Jessie is utterly trapped in an isolated lakeside house
that has become her prison—and comes face-to-face with her deepest, darkest

Jezal come home in a box. But then Glokta hates everyone: cutting treason

912,912,"NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER * Includes two new essays! NAMED ONE OF THE TEN
BEST BOOKS OF THE YEAR BY MICHIKO KAKUTANI, THE NEW YORK TIMES * NAMED ONE
OF THE BEST BOOKS OF THE YEAR BY BUZZFEED, THE GLOBE AND MAIL, AND LIBRARY
JOURNAL For readers of Nora Ephron, Tina Fey, and David Sedaris, this
hilarious, wise, and fiercely candid collection of personal essays
establishes Lena Dunham--the acclaimed creator, producer, and star of HBO's
Girls--as one of the most original young talents writing today. In Not That
Kind of Girl, Dunham illuminates the experiences that are part of making
one's way in the world: falling in love, feeling alone, being ten pounds
overweight despite eating only health food, having to prove yourself in a
room full of men twice your age, finding true love, and most of all, having
the guts to believe that your story is one that deserves to be told. ""Take
My Virginity (No Really, Take It)"" is the account of Dunham's first time,
and how her expectations of sex didn't quite live up to the actual event
(""No floodgate had been opened, no vault of true womanhood unlocked"");
""Girls & Jerks"" explores her former attraction to less-than-nice guys--guys
who had perfected the ""dynamic of disrespect"" she found so intriguing; ""Is
This Even Real?"" is a meditation on her lifelong obsession with death and
dying--what she calls her ""genetically predestined morbidity."" And in ""I
Didn't F*** Them, but They Yelled at Me,"" she imagines the tell-all she
will write when she is eighty and past caring, able to reflect honestly on
the sexism and condescension she has encountered in Hollywood, where women
are ""treated like the paper thingies that protect glasses in hotel
bathrooms--necessary but infinitely disposable."" Exuberant, moving, and
keenly observed, Not That Kind of Girl is a series of dispatches from the
frontlines of the struggle that is growing up. ""I'm already predicting my
future shame at thinking I had anything to offer you,"" Dunham writes. ""But
if I can take what I've learned and make one menial job easier for you, or
prevent you from having the kind of sex where you feel you must keep your
sneakers on in case you want to run away during the act, then every misstep
of mine will have been worthwhile."" Praise for Not That Kind of Girl ""The
gifted Ms. Dunham not only writes with observant precision, but also brings
a measure of perspective, nostalgia and an older person's sort of wisdom to
her portrait of her (not all that much) younger self and her world. . . .
As acute and heartfelt as it is funny.""--Michiko Kakutani, The New York
Times ""It's not Lena Dunham's candor that makes me gasp. Rather, it's her
writing--which is full of surprises where you least expect them. A fine,
subversive book.""--David Sedaris ""This book should be required reading for
anyone who thinks they understand the experience of being a young woman in
our culture. I thought I knew the author rather well, and I found many (not
altogether welcome) surprises.""--Carroll Dunham ""Witty, illuminating,
maddening, bracingly bleak . . . [Dunham] is a genuine artist, and a
disturber of the order.""--The Atlantic"
913,913,"The Challenge Built to Last, the defining management study of the nineties,
showed how great companies triumph over time and how long-term sustained
performance can be engineered into the DNA of an enterprise from the
verybeginning. But what about the company that is not born with great DNA?
How can good companies, mediocre companies, even bad companies achieve
enduring greatness? The Study For years, this question preyed on the mind
of Jim Collins. Are there companies that defy gravity and convert long-term
mediocrity or worse into long-term superiority? And if so, what are the
universal distinguishing characteristics that cause a company to go from
good to great? The Standards Using tough benchmarks, Collins and his
research team identified a set of elite companies that made the leap to
great results and sustained those results for at least fifteen years. How
great? After the leap, the good-to-great companies generated cumulative
stock returns that beat the general stock market by an average of seven
times in fifteen years, better than twice the results delivered by a
composite index of the world's greatest companies, including Coca-Cola,
Intel, General Electric, and Merck. The Comparisons The research team
contrasted the good-to-great companies with a carefully selected set of
comparison companies that failed to make the leap from good to great. What
was different? Why did one set of companies become truly great performers
while the other set remained only good? Over five years, the team analyzed
the histories of all twenty-eight companies in the study. After sifting
through mountains of data and thousands of pages of interviews, Collins and
his crew discovered the key determinants of greatness -- why some companies
make the leap and others don't. The Findings The findings of the Good to
Great study will surprise many readers and shed light on virtually every
area of management strategy and practice. The findings include: Level 5
Leaders: The research team was shocked to discover the type of leadership
required to achieve greatness. The Hedgehog Concept (Simplicity within the
Three Circles): To go from good to great requires transcending the curse of
competence. A Culture of Discipline: When you combine a culture of
discipline with an ethic of entrepreneurship, you get the magical alchemy
of great results. Technology Accelerators: Good-to-great companies think
differently about the role of technology. The Flywheel and the Doom Loop:
Those who launch radical change programs and wrenching restructurings will
almost certainly fail to make the leap. “Some of the key concepts discerned
in the study,” comments Jim Collins, ""fly in the face of our modern
business culture and will, quite frankly, upset some people.” Perhaps, but
who can afford to ignore these findings?"

Outing magazine, it was published in 1906. The story takes place in Yukon
Territory, Canada, during the 1890s Klondike Gold Rush and details White
Fang's journey to domestication. It is a companion novel (and a thematic
mirror) to London's best-known work, The Call of the Wild, which is about a
kidnapped, domesticated dog embracing his wild ancestry to survive and
thrive in the wild.Much of White Fang is written from the viewpoint of the

wild animals and the equally violent world of humans. The book also

941,941,"Tarmon Gai'don, the Last Battle, looms. And mankind is not ready. The final
volume of the Wheel of Time, A Memory of Light, was partially written by
Robert Jordan before his untimely passing in 2007. Brandon Sanderson, New
York Times bestselling author of the Mistborn books, was chosen by Jordan's
editor--his wife, Harriet McDougal--to complete the final book. The scope
and size of the volume was such that it could not be contained in a single
book, and so Tor proudly presents The Gathering Storm as the first of three
novels that will cover the outline left by Robert Jordan, chronicling
Tarmon Gai'don and Rand al'Thor's final confrontation with the Dark One.
This short sequence will complete the struggle against the Shadow, bringing
to a close a journey begun almost twenty years ago and marking the
conclusion of the Wheel of Time, the preeminent fantasy epic of our era. In
this epic novel, Robert Jordan's international bestselling series begins
its dramatic conclusion. Rand al'Thor, the Dragon Reborn, struggles to
unite a fractured network of kingdoms and alliances in preparation for the
Last Battle. As he attempts to halt the Seanchan encroachment northward--
wishing he could form at least a temporary truce with the invaders--his
allies watch in terror the shadow that seems to be growing within the heart
of the Dragon Reborn himself. Egwene al'Vere, the Amyrlin Seat of the rebel
Aes Sedai, is a captive of the White Tower and subject to the whims of
their tyrannical leader. As days tick toward the Seanchan attack she knows
is imminent, Egwene works to hold together the disparate factions of Aes
Sedai while providing leadership in the face of increasing uncertainty and
despair. Her fight will prove the mettle of the Aes Sedai, and her conflict
will decide the future of the White Tower--and possibly the world itself.
The Wheel of Time turns, and Ages come and pass. What was, what will be,
and what is, may yet fall under the Shadow."

veterinarian, and his menagerie of heartwarming, funny, and tragic animal
patients. For over forty years, generations of readers have thrilled to
Herriot's marvelous tales, deep love of life, and extraordinary
storytelling abilities. For decades, Herriot roamed the remote, beautiful
Yorkshire Dales, treating every patient that came his way from smallest to
largest, and observing animals and humans alike with his keen, loving eye.
In All Creatures Great and Small, we meet the young Herriot as he takes up
his calling and discovers that the realities of veterinary practice in
rural Yorkshire are very different from the sterile setting of veterinary
school. Some visits are heart-wrenchingly difficult, such as one to an old
man in the village whose very ill dog is his only friend and companion,
some are lighthearted and fun, such as Herriot's periodic visits to the
overfed and pampered Pekinese Tricki Woo who throws parties and has his own
stationery, and yet others are inspirational and enlightening, such as
Herriot's recollections of poor farmers who will scrape their meager
earnings together to be able to get proper care for their working animals.
From seeing to his patients in the depths of winter on the remotest
homesteads to dealing with uncooperative owners and critically ill animals,
Herriot discovers the wondrous variety and never-ending challenges of
veterinary practice as his humor, compassion, and love of the animal world
shine forth. James Herriot's memoirs have sold 80 million copies worldwide,

fans and newcomers alike will find that the ""freakquel"" is even bolder,
funnier, and more surprising than the first. SuperFreakonomics challenges
the way we think all over again, exploring the hidden side of everything
with such questions as: How is a street prostitute like a department store
Santa? Who adds more value: a pimp or a Realtor? What do hurricanes, heart
attacks, and highway deaths have in common? Did TV cause a rise in crime?
Can eating kangaroo meat save the planet? Whether investigating a solution
to global warming or explaining why the price of oral sex has fallen so
drastically, Levitt and Dubner show the world for what it really is—good,
bad, ugly, and, in the final analysis, superfreaky."

1119,1119,"With this extraordinary first volume in what promises to be an epoch-making
masterpiece, Neal Stephenson hacks into the secret histories of nations and
the private obsessions of men, decrypting with dazzling virtuosity the
forces that shaped this century. In 1942, Lawrence Pritchard Waterhouse -
mathematical genius and young Captain in the U.S. Navy - is assigned to
detachment 2702. It is an outfit so secret that only a handful of people
know it exists, and some of those people have names like Churchill and
Roosevelt. The mission of Watrehouse and Detatchment 2702-commanded by
Marine Raider Bobby Shaftoe-is to keep the Nazis ignorant of the fact that
Allied Intelligence has cracked the enemy's fabled Enigma code. It is a
game, a cryptographic chess match between Waterhouse and his German
counterpart, translated into action by the gung-ho Shaftoe and his forces.
Fast-forward to the present, where Waterhouse's crypto-hacker grandson,
Randy, is attempting to create a ""data haven"" in Southeast Asia - a place
where encrypted data can be stored and exchanged free of repression and
scrutiny. As governments and multinationals attack the endeavor, Randy
joins forces with Shaftoe's tough-as-nails grandaughter, Amy, to secretly
salvage a sunken Nazi sumarine that holds the key to keeping the dream of a
data haven afloat. But soon their scheme brings to light a massive
conspiracy with its roots in Detachment 2702 linked to an unbreakable Nazi
code called Arethusa. And it will represent the path to unimaginable riches
and a future of personal and digital liberty...or to universal
totalitarianism reborn. A breathtaking tour de force, and Neal Stephenson's
most accomplished and affecting work to date, CRYPTONOMICON is profound and
prophetic, hypnotic and hyper-driven, as it leaps forward and back between
World War II and the World Wide Web, hinting all the while at a dark day-
after-tomorrow. It is a work of great art, thought, and creative daring;
the product of a truly icon"

1121,1121,"Barbara Kingsolver, a writer praised for her""extravagantly gifted narrative
voice"" (New York Times Book Review), has created with this novel a hymn to
wildness that celebrates the prodigal spirit of human nature, and of nature
itself. Prodigal Summer weaves together three stories of human love within
a larger tapestry of lives inhabiting the forested mountains and struggling
small farms of southern Appalachia. At the heart of these intertwined
narratives is a den of coyotes that have recently migrated into the region.
Deanna Wolfe, a reclusive wildlife biologist, watches the forest from her
outpost in an isolated mountain cabin where she is caught off-guard by
Eddie Bondo, a young hunter who comes to invade her most private spaces and
confound her self-assured, solitary life. On a farm several miles down the
mountain, another web of lives unfolds as Lusa Maluf Landowski, a bookish
city girl turned farmer's wife, finds herself unexpectedly marooned in a
strange place where she must declare or lose her attachment to the land.
And a few more miles down the road, a pair of elderly, feuding neighbors
tend their respective farms and wrangle about God, pesticides, and the
complexities of a world neither of them expected. Over the course of one
humid summer, as the urge to procreate overtakes a green and profligate
countryside, these characters find connections to one another and to the
flora and fauna with which they necessarily share a place. Their
discoveries are embedded inside countless intimate lessons of biology, the
realities of small farming, and the final, urgent truth that humans are
only one part of life on earth. With the richness that characterizes
Barbara Kingsolver's finest work, Prodigal Summer embraces pure thematic
originality and demonstrates a balance of narrative and ideas that only an
accomplished novelist could render so beautifully."

Psychopath Test is the New York Times bestselling exploration of their
world and the madness industry. When Jon Ronson is drawn into an elaborate
hoax played on some of the world's top scientists, his investigation leads
him, unexpectedly, to psychopaths. He meets an influential psychologist who
is convinced that many important business leaders and politicians are in
fact high-flying, high-functioning psychopaths, and teaches Ronson how to
spot them. Armed with these new abilities, Ronson meets a patient inside an
asylum for the criminally insane who insists that he's sane, a mere run-of-
the-mill troubled youth, not a psychopath—a claim that might be only
manipulation, and a sign of his psychopathy. He spends time with a death-
squad leader institutionalized for mortgage fraud, and with a legendary CEO
who took joy in shutting down factories and firing people. He delves into
the fascinating history of psychopathy diagnosis and treatments, from LSD-
fueled days-long naked therapy sessions in prisons to attempts to
understand serial killers. Along the way, Ronson discovers that relatively
ordinary people are, more and more, defined by their most insane edges. The
Psychopath Test is a fascinating adventure through the minds of madness."

Barnes & Noble Classics pulls together a constellation of influences--
biographical, historical, and literary--to enrich each reader''s
understanding of these enduring works. The Complete Sherlock Holmes
comprises four novels and fifty-six short stories revolving around the
world''s most popular and influential fictional detective--the eccentric,
arrogant, and ingenious Sherlock Holmes. He and his trusted friend, Dr.
Watson, step from Holmes''s comfortable quarters at 221b Baker Street into
the swirling fog of Victorian London to exercise that unique combination of
detailed observation, vast knowledge, and brilliant deduction. Inevitably,
Holmes rescues the innocent, confounds the guilty, and solves the most
perplexing puzzles known to literature. The Complete Sherlock Holmes starts
with Holmes's first appearance, A Study in Scarle, a chilling murder novel
complete with bloodstained walls and cryptic clues, followed by the
baffling The Sign of Four, which introduces Holmes's cocaine problem and
Watson's future wife. The story collections The Adventures of Sherlock
Holmes and The Memoirs of Sherlock Holmes feature such renowned tales as ""A
Scandal in Bohemia,"" ""The Red-Headed League,"" and ""The Musgrave Ritual.""
Tired of writing stories about Holmes, his creator, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle,
killed him off at the end of ""The Final Problem,"" the last tale in The
Memoirs. But the public outcry was so great that eight years later he
published the masterful The Hound of the Baskervilles, which supposedly
takes place before Holmes's death. The separate Volume II of The Complete
Sherlock Holmes collects the remaining accounts of Holmes''s exploits,
including ""The Adventure of the Empty House,"" which reveals the elaborate
circumstances behind Holmes''s literary resurrection. Kyle Freeman, a

illuminate the ways all of us organize experience in this ""delightful""
(Bloomberg News) collection of writings from The New Yorker. What is the
difference between choking and panicking? Why are there dozens of varieties
of mustard-but only one variety of ketchup? What do football players teach
us about how to hire teachers? What does hair dye tell us about the history
of the 20th century? In the past decade, Malcolm Gladwell has written three
books that have radically changed how we understand our world and
ourselves: The Tipping Point; Blink; and Outliers. Now, in What the Dog
Saw, he brings together, for the first time, the best of his writing from
The New Yorker over the same period. Here is the bittersweet tale of the
inventor of the birth control pill, and the dazzling inventions of the
pasta sauce pioneer Howard Moscowitz. Gladwell sits with Ron Popeil, the
king of the American kitchen, as he sells rotisserie ovens, and divines the
secrets of Cesar Millan, the ""dog whisperer"" who can calm savage animals
with the touch of his hand. He explores intelligence tests and ethnic
profiling and ""hindsight bias"" and why it was that everyone in Silicon
Valley once tripped over themselves to hire the same college graduate.
""Good writing,"" Gladwell says in his preface, ""does not succeed or fail on
the strength of its ability to persuade. It succeeds or fails on the
strength of its ability to engage you, to make you think, to give you a
glimpse into someone else's head."" What the Dog Saw is yet another example
of the buoyant spirit and unflagging curiosity that have made Malcolm
Gladwell our most brilliant investigator of the hidden extraordinary."

here is the definitive edition of the book acclaimed as ""the most affecting

Yorker). The Pulitzer Prize-winning Maus tells the story of Vladek
Spiegelman, a Jewish survivor of Hitler's Europe, and his son, a cartoonist
coming to terms with his father's story. Maus approaches the unspeakable
through the diminutive. Its form, the cartoon (the Nazis are cats, the Jews
mice), shocks us out of any lingering sense of familiarity and succeeds in
""drawing us closer to the bleak heart of the Holocaust"" (The New York
Times). Maus is a haunting tale within a tale. Vladek's harrowing story of
survival is woven into the author's account of his tortured relationship
with his aging father. Against the backdrop of guilt brought by survival,
they stage a normal life of small arguments and unhappy visits. This
astonishing retelling of our century's grisliest news is a story of
survival, not only of Vladek but of the children who survive even the
survivors. Maus studies the bloody pawprints of history and tracks its
meaning for all of us."

is a restless farm wife who gave up her own plans when she accidentally
became pregnant at seventeen. Now, after a decade of domestic disharmony on
a failing farm, she seeks momentary escape through an obsessive flirtation
with a younger man. She hikes up a mountain road behind her house toward a
secret tryst, but instead encounters a shocking sight: a silent, forested
valley filled with what looks like a lake of fire. She can only understand
it as a cautionary miracle, but it sparks a raft of other explanations from
scientists, religious leaders, and the media. The bewildering emergency
draws rural farmers into unexpected acquaintance with urbane journalists,
opportunists, sightseers, and a striking biologist with his own stake in
the outcome. As the community lines up to judge the woman and her miracle,
Dellarobia confronts her family, her church, her town, and a larger world,
in a flight toward truth that could undo all she has ever believed."

hidden refuge called Fablehaven to prevent their extinction. The sanctuary
survives today as one of the last strongholds of true magic. Enchanting?
Absolutely. Exciting? You bet. Safe? Well, actually, quite the opposite.
Kendra and her brother, Seth, have no idea that their grandfather is the
current caretaker of Fablehaven. Inside the gated woods, ancient laws keep
relative order among greedy trolls, mischievous satyrs, plotting witches,
spiteful imps, and jealous fairies. However, when the rules get broken --
Seth is a bit too curious and reckless for his own good -- powerful forces
of evil are unleashed, and Kendra and her brother face the greatest
challenge of their lives. To save their family, Fablehaven, and perhaps
even the world, Kendra and Seth must find the courage to do what they fear
most."

1425,1425,"A captivating and mystical story of life and love during the wartime
Italian occupation of the isolated Greek island of Cephallonia.
Extravagant, inventive, emotionally sweeping, this rich and lyrical,
heartbreaking and hilarious novel has been widely hailed as a classic. Set
on the peaceful island of Cephallonia, just as the horrors of World War II
reach its remote shores, Corelli's Mandolin is ""an exuberant mixture of
history and romance, written with a wit that is incandescent"" (Los Angeles
Times Book Review). Corelli's Mandolin is the story of a timeless place
that one day wakes up to find itself in the jaws of history. The place is
the Greek island of Cephallonia, where gods once dabbled in the affairs of
men and the local saint periodically rises from his sarcophagus to cure the
mad. Then the tide of World War II rolls onto the island's shores in the
form of the conquering Italian army. Caught in the midst of the occupation
are Pelagia, a willful, beautiful young woman, and the two suitors vying
for her love and affection: Mandras, a gentle fisherman turned ruthless,
murderous guerilla, and the charming, mandolin-playing Captain Corelli, a
reluctant officer of the Italian garrison on the island. Rich with
loyalties and betrayals, and set against a landscape where the factual
blends seamlessly with the fantastic, Corelli's Mandolin is a passionate
novel as rich in ideas as it is genuinely moving."

suburban home. But everything changes when they receive notice that an aunt
whom they didn't know existed has died and left them her flat in an
apartment block overlooking Highgate Cemetery in London. They feel that at
last their own lives can begin ... but have no idea that they've been
summoned into a tangle of fraying lives, from the obsessive-compulsive
crossword setter who lives above them to their aunt's mysterious and
elusive lover who lives below them, and even to their aunt herself, who
never got over her estrangement from the twins' mother - and who can't even
seem to quite leave her flat.... With Highgate Cemetery itself a character
and echoes of Henry James and Charles Dickens, HER FEARFUL SYMMETRY is a
delicious and deadly twenty-first-century ghost story about Niffenegger's
familiar themes of love, loss and identity. It is certain to cement her

Dickinson is an essential volume for all lovers of American literature.
Only eleven of Emily Dickinson's poems were published prior to her death in
1886; the startling originality of her work doomed it to obscurity in her
lifetime. Early posthumous published collections -- some of them featuring
liberally ""edited"" versions of the poems -- did not fully and accurately
represent Dickinson's bold experiments in prosody, her tragic vision, and
the range of her intellectual and emotional explorations. Not until the
1955 publication of The Complete Poems of Emily Dickinson, a three-volume
critical edition compiled by Thomas H. Johnson, were readers able for the
first time to assess, understand, and appreciate the whole of Dickinson's
extraordinary poetic genius. This book, a distillation of the three-volume
Complete Poems, brings together the original texts of all 1,775 poems that
Emily Dickinson wrote. ""With its chronological arrangement of the poems,
this volume becomes more than just a collection; it is at the same time a
poetic biography of the thoughts and feelings of a woman whose beauty was
deep and lasting."" --San Francisco Chronicle"

1459,1459,"The riveting, mega-bestselling, beloved and highly acclaimed memoir of a
man, a vocation, and an era named one of the ten best nonfiction titles of
the year by Time and Entertainment Weekly. In the mid-seventies, Steve
Martin exploded onto the comedy scene. By 1978 he was the biggest concert
draw in the history of stand-up. In 1981 he quit forever. This book is, in
his own words, the story of “why I did stand-up and why I walked away.”
Emmy and Grammy Award–winner, author of the acclaimed New York Times
bestsellers Shopgirl and The Pleasure of My Company, and a regular
contributor to The New Yorker, Martin has always been a writer. His memoir
of his years in stand-up is candid, spectacularly amusing, and beautifully
written. At age ten Martin started his career at Disneyland, selling
guidebooks in the newly opened theme park. In the decade that followed, he
worked in the Disney magic shop and the Bird Cage Theatre at Knott’s Berry
Farm, performing his first magic/comedy act a dozen times a week. The story
of these years, during which he practiced and honed his craft, is moving
and revelatory. The dedication to excellence and innovation is formed at an
astonishingly early age and never wavers or wanes. Martin illuminates the
sacrifice, discipline, and originality that made him an icon and informs
his work to this day. To be this good, to perform so frequently, was
isolating and lonely. It took Martin decades to reconnect with his parents
and sister, and he tells that story with great tenderness. Martin also
paints a portrait of his times—the era of free love and protests against
the war in Vietnam, the heady irreverence of The Smothers Brothers Comedy
Hour in the late sixties, and the transformative new voice of Saturday
Night Live in the seventies. Throughout the text, Martin has placed
photographs, many never seen before. Born Standing Up is a superb testament
to the sheer tenacity, focus, and daring of one of the greatest and most
iconoclastic comedians of all time."

simple, but the results were extraordinary. ""You are invited to anonymously
contribute a secret to a group art project. Your secret can be a regret,

anything -- as long as it is true and you have never shared it with anyone
before. Be brief. Be legible. Be creative."" It all began with an idea Frank
Warren had for a community art project. He began handing out postcards to
strangers and leaving them in public places -- asking people to write down
a secret they had never told anyone and mail it to him, anonymously. The
response was overwhelming. The secrets were both provocative and profound,
and the cards themselves were works of art -- carefully and creatively
constructed by hand. Addictively compelling, the cards reveal our deepest
fears, desires, regrets, and obsessions. Frank calls them ""graphic haiku,""
beautiful, elegant, and small in structure but powerfully emotional. As
Frank began posting the cards on his website, PostSecret took on a life of
its own, becoming much more than a simple art project. It has grown into a
global phenomenon, exposing our individual aspirations, fantasies, and
frailties -- our common humanity. Every day dozens of postcards still make
their way to Frank, with postmarks from around the world, touching on every
aspect of human experience. This extraordinary collection brings together
the most powerful, personal, and beautifully intimate secrets Frank Warren
has received -- and brilliantly illuminates that human emotions can be

reflects on family, love life, and the absurdities of adulthood with
""cheeky candor"" and signature wit (Philadelphia Inquirer). Life doesn't get
more hilarious than when Chelsea Handler takes aim with her irreverent wit.
Who else would send all-staff emails to smoke out the dumbest people on her
show? Now, in this new collection of original essays, the #1 bestselling
author of Are You There, Vodka? It's Me, Chelsea delivers one laugh-out-
loud moment after another as she sets her sights on the ridiculous side of
childhood, adulthood, and daughterhood. Family moments are fair game,
whether it's writing a report on Reaganomics to earn a Cabbage Patch doll,
or teaching her father social graces by ordering him to stay indoors. It's
open season on her love life, from playing a prank on her boyfriend (using
a ravioli, a fake autopsy, and the Santa Monica pier) to adopting a dog so
she can snuggle with someone who doesn't talk. And everyone better duck for
cover when her beach vacation turns into matchmaking gone wild.
Outrageously funny and deliciously wicked, Chelsea Chelsea Bang Bang is
good good good good! Chelsea Handler on . . . Being unpopular: ""My parents
couldn't have been more unreasonable when it came to fads or clothes that
weren't purchased at a pharmacy."" Living with her boyfriend: ""He's similar
to a large toddler, the only difference being he doesn't cry when he wakes
up."" Appreciating her brother: ""He's a certified public accountant, and I
have a real life."" Arm-wrestling a maid of honor: ""It wasn't her strength
that intimidated me. It was the starry way her eyes focused on me, like
Mike Tyson getting ready to feed."""

anyone else, Ramona goes from strength to strength, winding up by inviting
her entire kindergarten class to a part at her home without mentioning it

semester at school. But that’s easier said than done when you’re a CIA
legacy and go to the premier school in the world...for spies. Despite
Cammie's best intentions, trouble crops up quickly. Cammie, Bex, and Liz
learn that the Gallagher Academy is hosting guests from another spy school
-- a school that is known to the world as the Ethan Frome Academy--a secret
spy school for boys. After her fiasco with Josh last fall, Cammie isn't
sure she's ready for daily encounters with boy spies – especially after she

Cammie is right to be worried about their new guests. Soon after the boys’

school's top-secret status at risk. And the perfectly crushable Zach is her
prime suspect. The Gallagher Girls will need to use all their skills to

this time, and the stakes for Cammie’s heart—and her beloved school— are

BOOKLIST In her now classic novel Outlander, Diana Gabaldon told the story
of Claire Randall, an English ex-combat nurse who walks through a stone
circle in the Scottish Highlands in 1946, and disappears . . . into 1743.
The story unfolded from there in seven bestselling novels, and CNN has
called it ""a grand adventure written on a canvas that probes the heart,
weighs the soul and measures the human spirit across [centuries]."" Now the
story continues in Written in My Own Heart's Blood. 1778: France declares
war on Great Britain, the British army leaves Philadelphia, and George
Washington's troops leave Valley Forge in pursuit. At this moment, Jamie
Fraser returns from a presumed watery grave to discover that his best
friend has married his wife, his illegitimate son has discovered (to his
horror) who his father really is, and his beloved nephew, Ian, wants to
marry a Quaker. Meanwhile, Jamie's wife, Claire, and his sister, Jenny, are
busy picking up the pieces. The Frasers can only be thankful that their
daughter Brianna and her family are safe in twentieth-century Scotland. Or
not. In fact, Brianna is searching for her own son, who was kidnapped by a
man determined to learn her family's secrets. Her husband, Roger, has
ventured into the past in search of the missing boy . . . never suspecting
that the object of his quest has not left the present. Now, with Roger out
of the way, the kidnapper can focus on his true target: Brianna herself.

1685,1685,"From the author of Ready Player One, a rollicking alien invasion thriller
that embraces and subverts science-fiction conventions as only Ernest Cline
can. Zack Lightman has never much cared for reality. He vastly prefers the
countless science-fiction movies, books, and videogames he's spent his life
consuming. And too often, he catches himself wishing that some fantastic,
impossible, world-altering event could arrive to whisk him off on a grand
spacefaring adventure. So when he sees the flying saucer, he's sure his
years of escapism have finally tipped over into madness. Especially because
the alien ship he's staring at is straight out of his favorite videogame, a
flight simulator callled Armada--in which gamers just happen to be
protecting Earth from alien invaders. As impossible as it seems, what
Zack's seeing is all too real. And it's just the first in a blur of
revlations that will force him to question everything he thought he knew
about Earth's history, its future, even his own life--and to play the hero
for real, with humanity's life in the balance. But even through the terror
and exhilaration, he can't help thinking: Doesn't something about this
scenario feel a little bit like . . . well . . . fiction? At once
reinventing and paying homage to science-fiction classics, Armada is a
rollicking, surprising thriller, a coming-of-age adventure, and an alien
invasion tale like nothing you've ever read before. Praise for Armada ""A

Doré (1832-1883) was one of the busiest, most in-demand artists of the 19th
century, made his name illustrating works by such authors as Rabelais,
Balzac, Milton, and Dante. The engravings here made just before his death

1798,1798,"Now in paperback, the New York Times bestseller by one of rock's most
provocative figures Scar Tissue is Anthony Kiedis's searingly honest memoir
of a life spent in the fast lane. In 1983, four self-described
""knuckleheads"" burst out of the mosh-pitted mosaic of the neo-punk rock
scene in L.A. with their own unique brand of cosmic hardcore mayhem funk.
Over twenty years later, the Red Hot Chili Peppers, against all odds, have
become one of the most successful bands in the world. Though the band has
gone through many incarnations, Anthony Kiedis, the group's lyricist and
dynamic lead singer, has been there for the whole roller-coaster ride.
Whether he's recollecting the influence of the beautiful, strong women who
have been his muses, or retracing a journey that has included appearances
as diverse as a performance before half a million people at Woodstock or an
audience of one at the humble compound of the exiled Dalai Lama, Kiedis
shares a compelling story about the price of success and excess. Scar
Tissue is a story of dedication and debauchery, of intrigue and integrity,
of recklessness and redemption -- a story that could only have come out of
the world of rock."

characters are brilliant conversationalists, including the princesses

Orlando meet and fall in love, the princesses and Touchstone go into exile
in the Forest of Arden, where they find new conversational partners. Duke
Frederick, younger brother to Duke Senior, has overthrown his brother and
forced him to live homeless in the forest with his courtiers, including the
cynical Jaques. Orlando, whose older brother Oliver plotted his death, has
fled there, too. Recent scholars have also grounded the play in the issues
of its time. These include primogeniture, passing property from a father to
his oldest son. As You Like It depicts intense conflict between brothers,
exposing the human suffering that primogeniture entails. Another
perspective concerns crossdressing. Most of Orlando’s courtship of Rosalind
takes place while Rosalind is disguised as a man, “Ganymede.” At her
urging, Orlando pretends that Ganymede is his beloved Rosalind. But as the
epilogue reveals, the sixteenth-century actor playing Rosalind was male,
following the practice of the time. In other words, a boy played a girl
playing a boy pretending to be a girl. The authoritative edition of As You

and abuse of the environment reveal the truth behind the world's great
collapses, from the Anasazi of North America to the Vikings of Greenland to
modern Montana. What emerges is a fundamental pattern of environmental
catastrophe---one whose warning signs surround us today and that we ignore

historical perspective into a narrative that is impossible to put down,
Collapse exposes the deepest mysteries of the past even as it offers hope
for the future. ""Diamond's most influential gift may be his ability to
write about geopolitical and environmental systems in ways that don't just
educate and provoke, but entertain."" ""Extremely persuasive ... replete with
fascinating stories, a treasure trove of historical anecdotes [and]

1922,1922,"Over the course of seven novels, Tom Clancy's ""genius for big, compelling
plots"" and his ""natural narrative gift"" (The New York Times Magazine) have
mesmerized tens of millions of readers and established him as one of the
preeminent storytellers of our time. Without Remorse, however, goes beyond
anything he has ever done. Its hero is John Kelly, a man well familiar to
Clancy's readers by his code name, Mr. Clark. In The Sum of All Fears, he
hunted down nuclear terrorists. In Clear and Present Danger, he led aerial
raids against drug lords. In The Cardinal of the Kremlin, he spirited away
a KGB chief's family by submarine. But nothing will ever be as deadly - or
as personal - as the danger he must face in Without Remorse. John Kelly,
former Navy SEAL and Vietnam veteran, is still getting over the accidental
death of his wife six months before, when he befriends a young woman with a
decidedly checkered past. When that past reaches out for her in a
particularly horrifying fashion, he vows revenge and, assembling all of his
old skills, sets out to track down the men responsible, before it can
happen again. At the same time, the Pentagon is readying an operation to
rescue a key group of prisoners in a North Vietnamese prisoner-of-war camp.
One man, they find, knows the terrain around the camp better than anyone
else they have: a certain former Navy SEAL named John Kelly. Kelly has his
own mission. The Pentagon wants him for theirs. Attempting to juggle the
two, Kelly (now code-named Mr. Clark) finds himself confronted by a vast
array of enemies, both at home and abroad - men so skillful that the
slightest misstep means death. And the fate of dozens of people, including
Kelly himself, restson his making sure that misstep never happens. Men
aren't born dangerous. They grow dangerous. And the most dangerous of all,
Kelly learns, are the ones you least expect... As Clancy takes us through
the twists and turns of Without Remorse, he blends the exceptional realism
and authenticity that are his hallmarks with intricate plotting, knife-edge
suspense and a remarkable cast of characters."

how an unexpected romantic encounter irrevocably changes two families’
lives. One Sunday afternoon in Southern California, Bert Cousins shows up
at Franny Keating’s christening party uninvited. Before evening falls, he
has kissed Franny’s mother, Beverly—thus setting in motion the dissolution
of their marriages and the joining of two families. Spanning five decades,
Commonwealth explores how this chance encounter reverberates through the
lives of the four parents and six children involved. Spending summers
together in Virginia, the Keating and Cousins children forge a lasting bond
that is based on a shared disillusionment with their parents and the
strange and genuine affection that grows up between them. When, in her
twenties, Franny begins an affair with the legendary author Leon Posen and
tells him about her family, the story of her siblings is no longer hers to
control. Their childhood becomes the basis for his wildly successful book,
ultimately forcing them to come to terms with their losses, their guilt,
and the deeply loyal connection they feel for one another. Told with equal
measures of humor and heartbreak, Commonwealth is a meditation on
inspiration, interpretation, and the ownership of stories. It is a
brilliant and tender tale of the far-reaching ties of love and
responsibility that bind us together."

Everything on the surface seems fine, but underneath run very deep and

running far away to pursue some new dream? Raeanne goes after painkillers,

the girls were 9, Daddy started to turn to his beloved Kaeleigh in ways a
father never should and has been sexually abusing her for years. For
Raeanne, she needs to numb the pain of not being Daddy's favorite; for
Kaeleigh, she wants to do everything she can to feel something normal, even
if it means cutting herself and vomiting after every binge. How Kaeleigh
and Raeanne figure out just what it means to be whole again when their

France. Némirovsky's death in Auschwitz in 1942 prevented her from seeing

planned novel sequence, Suite Française, would be rediscovered and hailed
as a masterpiece. Set during the year that France fell to the Nazis, Suite

of the most widely read storytellers in the world. Now he introduces a
startling, original new character: a man with perfect memory who must solve
his own family's murder. MEMORY MAN Amos Decker's life changed forever--
twice. The first time was on the gridiron. A big, towering athlete, he was
the only person from his hometown of Burlington ever to go pro. But his
career ended before it had a chance to begin. On his very first play, a
violent helmet-to-helmet collision knocked him off the field for good, and
left him with an improbable side effect--he can never forget anything. The
second time was at home nearly two decades later. Now a police detective,
Decker returned from a stakeout one evening and entered a nightmare--his
wife, young daughter, and brother-in-law had been murdered. His family
destroyed, their killer's identity as mysterious as the motive behind the
crime, and unable to forget a single detail from that horrible night,
Decker finds his world collapsing around him. He leaves the police force,
loses his home, and winds up on the street, taking piecemeal jobs as a
private investigator when he can. But over a year later, a man turns
himself in to the police and confesses to the murders. At the same time a
horrific event nearly brings Burlington to its knees, and Decker is called
back in to help with this investigation. Decker also seizes his chance to
learn what really happened to his family that night. To uncover the
stunning truth, he must use his remarkable gifts and confront the burdens
that go along with them. He must endure the memories he would much rather
forget. And he may have to make the ultimate sacrifice. MEMORY MAN will
stay with you long after the turn of the final page."
2058,2058,"The International Bestseller Now a major motion picture from Netflix,
directed by Dee Rees, nominated in four categories for the Academy Awards.
In Jordan's prize-winning debut, prejudice takes many forms, both subtle
and brutal. It is 1946, and city-bred Laura McAllan is trying to raise her
children on her husband's Mississippi Delta farm—a place she finds foreign
and frightening. In the midst of the family's struggles, two young men
return from the war to work the land. Jamie McAllan, Laura's brother-in-
law, is everything her husband is not—charming, handsome, and haunted by
his memories of combat. Ronsel Jackson, eldest son of the black
sharecroppers who live on the McAllan farm, has come home with the shine of
a war hero. But no matter his bravery in defense of his country, he is
still considered less than a man in the Jim Crow South. It is the unlikely
friendship of these brothers-in-arms that drives this powerful novel to its
inexorable conclusion. The men and women of each family relate their
versions of events and we are drawn into their lives as they become players
in a tragedy on the grandest scale. As Barbara Kingsolver says of Hillary
Jordan, ""Her characters walked straight out of 1940s Mississippi and into
the part of my brain where sympathy and anger and love reside, leaving my
heart racing. They are with me still."""

2083,2083,"Elon Musk is the most daring entrepreneur of our time There are few
industrialists in history who could match Elon Musk's relentless drive and
ingenious vision. A modern alloy of Thomas Edison, Henry Ford, Howard
Hughes, and Steve Jobs, Musk is the man behind PayPal, Tesla Motors,
SpaceX, and SolarCity, each of which has sent shock waves throughout
American business and industry. More than any other executive today, Musk
has dedicated his energies and his own vast fortune to inventing a future
that is as rich and far-reaching as a science fiction fantasy. In this
lively, investigative account, veteran technology journalist Ashlee Vance
offers an unprecedented look into the remarkable life and times of Silicon
Valley's most audacious businessman. Written with exclusive access to Musk,
his family, and his friends, the book traces his journey from his difficult
upbringing in South Africa to his ascent to the pinnacle of the global
business world. Vance spent more than fifty hours in conversation with Musk
and interviewed close to three hundred people to tell the tumultuous
stories of Musk's world-changing companies and to paint a portrait of a
complex man who has renewed American industry and sparked new levels of
innovation—all while making plenty of enemies along the way. In 1992, Elon
Musk arrived in the United States as a ferociously driven immigrant bent on
realizing his wildest dreams. Since then, Musk's roller-coaster life has
brought him grave disappointments alongside massive successes. After being
forced out of PayPal, fending off a life-threatening case of malaria, and
dealing with the death of his infant son, Musk abandoned Silicon Valley for
Los Angeles. He spent the next few years baffling his friends by blowing
his entire fortune on rocket ships and electric cars. Cut to 2012, however,
and Musk had mounted one of the greatest resurrections in business history:
Tesla, SpaceX, and SolarCity had enjoyed unparalleled success, and Musk's
net worth soared to more than $5 billion. At a time when many American
companies are more interested in chasing easy money than in taking bold
risks on radical new technology, Musk stands out as the only businessman
with enough dynamism and vision to tackle—and even revolutionize—three
industries at once. Vance makes the case that Musk's success heralds a
return to the original ambition and invention that made America an economic
and intellectual powerhouse. Elon Musk is a brilliant, penetrating
examination of what Musk's career means for a technology industry
undergoing dramatic change and offers a taste of what could be an
incredible century ahead."

Three races that humans have clashed with before have allied to halt our
expansion into space. Their linchpin: the turncoat military scientist
Charles Boutin, who knows the CDF’s biggest military secrets. To prevail,
the CDF must find out why Boutin did what he did. Jared Dirac is the only
human who can provide answers -- a superhuman hybrid, created from Boutin's

But when the memory transplant appears to fail, Jared is given to the Ghost

slowly surface, Jared begins to intuit the reason’s for Boutin’s betrayal.

with his own choices. Time is running out: The alliance is preparing its
offensive, and some of them plan worse things than humanity’s mere military

doesn't quite take, Dirac is handed off to a battalion for routine but
closely monitored training. Just when Dirac is getting comfortable with his
own identity, however, Boutin's memories kick in, and Dirac and his team
are summarily dispatched to an enemy planet to capture Boutin and solve the

weaves together action, memorable characterizations, and a touch of

2159,2159,"""This is not a book about charismatic visionary leaders. It is not about
visionary product concepts or visionary products or visionary market
insights. Nor is it about just having a corporate vision. This is a book
about something far more important, enduring, and substantial. This is a
book about visionary companies."" So write Jim Collins and Jerry Porras in
this groundbreaking book that shatters myths, provides new insights, and
gives practical guidance to those who would like to build landmark
companies that stand the test of time. Drawing upon a six-year research
project at the Stanford University Graduate School of Business, Collins and
Porras took eighteen truly exceptional and long-lasting companies -- they
have an average age of nearly one hundred years and have outperformed the
general stock market by a factor of fifteen since 1926 -- and studied each
company in direct comparison to one of its top competitors. They examined
the companies from their very beginnings to the present day -- as start-
ups, as midsize companies, and as large corporations. Throughout, the
authors asked: ""What makes the truly exceptional companies different from
other companies?"" What separates General Electric, 3M, Merck, Wal-Mart,
Hewlett-Packard, Walt Disney, and Philip Morris from their rivals? How, for
example, did Procter & Gamble, which began life substantially behind rival
Colgate, eventually prevail as the premier institution in its industry? How
was Motorola able to move from a humble battery repair business into
integrated circuits and cellular communications, while Zenith never became
dominant in anything other than TVs? How did Boeing unseat McDonnell
Douglas as the world's best commercial aircraft company -- what did Boeing
have that McDonnell Douglas lacked? By answering such questions, Collins
and Porras go beyond the incessant barrage of management buzzwords and fads
of the day to discover timeless qualities that have consistently
distinguished out-standing companies. They also provide inspiration to all
executives and entrepreneurs by destroying the false but widely accepted
idea that only charismatic visionary leaders can build visionary companies.
Filled with hundreds of specific examples and organized into a coherent
framework of practical concepts that can be applied by managers and
entrepreneurs at all levels, Built to Last provides a master blueprint for
building organizations that will prosper long into the twenty-first century
and beyond."

2175,2175,"PrefaceThe New International Version is a completely new translation of the
Holy Bible made by over a hundred scholars working directly from the best
available Hebrew, Aramaic and Greek texts. It had its beginning in 1965
when, after several years of exploratory study by committees from the
Christian Reformed Church and the National Association of Evangelicals, a
group of scholars met at Palos Heights, Illinois, and concurred in the need
for a new translation of the Bible in contemporary English. This group,
though not made up of official church representatives, was
transdenominational. Its conclusion was endorsed by a large number of
leaders from many denominations who met in Chicago in 1966.Responsibility
for the new version was delegated by the Palos Heights group to a self-
governing body of fifteen, the Committee on Bible Translation, composed for
the most part of biblical scholars from colleges, universities and
seminaries. In 1967 the New York Bible Society (now the International Bible
Society) generously undertook the financial sponsorship of the project -- a
sponsorship that made it possible to enlist the help of many distinguished
scholars. The fact that participants from the United States, Great Britain,
Canada, Australia and New Zealand worked together gave the project its
international scope. That they were from many denominations -including
Anglican, Assemblies of God, Baptist, Brethren, Christian Reformed, Church
of Christ, Evangelical Free, Lutheran, Mennonite, Methodist, Nazarene,
Presbyterian, Wesleyan and other churches -- helped to safeguard the
translation from sectarian bias.How it was made helps to give the New
International Version its distinctiveness. Thetranslation of each book was
assigned to a team of scholars. Next, one of the Intermediate Editorial
Committees revised the initial translation, with constant reference to the
Hebrew, Aramaic or Greek. Their work then went to one of the General
Editorial Cominittees, which checked it in detail and made another thorough
revision. This revision in turn was carefully reviewed by the Committee on
Bible Translation, which made further changes and then released the final
version for publication. In this way the entire Bible underwent three
revisions, during each of which the translation was examined for its
faithfulness to the original languages and for its English style, All this
involved many thousands of hours of research and discussion regarding the
meaning of the texts and the precise way of putting them into English. It
may well be that no other translation has been made by a more thorough
process of review and revision from committee to committee than this
one.From the beginning of the project, the Committee on Bible Translation
held to certain goals for the New International Version: that it would be
an accurate translation and one that would have clarity and literary
quality and so prove suitable for public and private reading, teaching,
preaching, memorizing and liturgical use. The Committee also sought to
preserve some measure of continuity with the long tradition of translating
the Scriptures into English.In working toward these goals, the translators
were united in their commitment to the authority and infallibility of the
Bible as God's Word in written form. They believe that it contains the
divine answer to the deepest needs of humanity, that it sheds unique light
on our pathin a dark world, and that it sets forth the way to our eternal
well-being.The first concern of the translators has been the accuracy of
the translation and its fidelity to the thought of the biblical writers.
They have weighed the significance of the lexical and grammatical details
of the Hebrew, Aramaic and Greek texts. At the same time, they have striven
for more than a word-for-word translation, Because thought Patterns and
syntax differ from language to language, faithful communication of the
meaning of the writers of the Bible demands frequent modifications in
sentence structure and constant regard for the contextual meanings of
words.A sensitive feeling for style does not always accompany scholarship.
Accordingly the Committee on Bible Translation submitted the developing
version to a number of stylistic consultants. Two of them read every book
of both Old and New Testaments twice -- once before once after the last
major revision -- and made invaluable suggestions. Samples of the
translation were tested for clarity and ease of reading by various kinds of
people -- young and old, highly educated and less well educated ministers
and laymen.Concern for clear and natural English -- that the New
International Version should be idiomatic but not idiosyncratic,
contemporary but not dated -- motivated the translators and consultants .
At the same time, they tried to reflect the differing styles of the
biblical writers. In view of the international use of English, the
translators sought to avoid obvious Americanisms on the one hand and
obvious Anglicisms on the other. A British edition reflects the
comparatively few differences of significant idiom and of spelling.As for
the traditionalpronouns ""thou,"" ""thee"" and ""thine"" in reference to the
Deity, the translators judged that to use these archaisins (along with the
old verb forms such as ""doest,"" ""wouldest"" and ""hadst"") would violate
accuracy 'in translation. Neither Hebrew, Aramaic nor Greek uses special
pronouns for the persons of the Godhead. A present-day translation is not
enhanced by forms that in the time of the King James Version were used in
everyday speech, whether referring to God or man.For the Old Testament the
standard Hebrew text, the Masoretic Text as published in the latest
editions of ""Biblia Hebraica, was used throughout. The Dead Sea Scrolls
contain material bearing on an earlier stage of the Hebrew text. They were
consulted, as were the Samaritan Pentateuch and the ancient scribal
traditions relating to textual changes. Sometimes a variant Hebrew reading
in the margin of the Masoretic: Text was followed instead of the text
itself. Such instances, being variants within the Masoretic tradition, are
not specified by footnotes. In rare cases, words in the consonantal text
were divided differently from the way they appear in the Masoretic Text.

children of aristocrats learn how to address an earl and curtsey before a
prince - while other dictates of the ton are unspoken yet universally
understood. A proper duke should be imperious and aloof. A young,
marriageable lady should be amiable . . . but not too amiable. Daphne
Bridgerton has always failed at the latter. The fourth of eight siblings in
her close-knit family, she has formed friendships with the most eligible
young men in London. Everyone likes Daphne for her kindness and wit. But no
one truly desires her. She is simply too deuced honest for that, too
unwilling to play the romantic games that captivate gentlemen. Amiability
is not a characteristic shared by Simon Basset, Duke of Hastings. Recently
returned to England from abroad, he intends to shun both marriage and
society - just as his callous father shunned Simon throughout his painful
childhood. Yet an encounter with his best friend's sister offers another
option. If Daphne agrees to a fake courtship, Simon can deter the mamas who
parade their daughters before him. Daphne, meanwhile, will see her
prospects and her reputation soar. The plan works like a charm-at first.

2221,2221,"A Major New Translation For more than two centuries the very title of this
book has evoked the sensitivity of youth, the suffering of the artist, the
idea of a hero too full of love to live. When it was first published in
Germany, in 1774, The Sorrows of Young Werther created a sensation. Banned
and condemned but embraced--especially by the young--it has continued to
captivate. Now Burton Pike's startlingly new translation expresses as never
before all the anguish, ideas, and ardor of this seminal, iconic novel. And
his Introduction reveals both Goethe's inspirations and his influence--on
works ranging from Madame Bovary to Frankenstein and beyond. Here is the
classic story of Werther, a young man ""seeking the infinite"" in an art he
cannot master and a woman he cannot have--the prototype of the Romantic
hero in a work that anticipated the Romantic Age. Here is a bold new look
at a masterpiece that has changed lives and, like its beloved hero, will
never grow old."

and college years oscillating between enthusiastic carnivore and occasional
vegetarian. As he became a husband, and then a father, the moral dimensions
of eating became increasingly important to him. Faced with the prospect of
being unable to explain why we eat some animals and not others, Foer set
out to explore the origins of many eating traditions and the fictions

chicken we fry, and every burger we grill. Part memoir and part

2255,2255,"WINNER OF THE NOBEL PRIZE IN LITERATURE The celebrated first memoir from
arguably the most influential singer-songwriter in the country, Bob Dylan.
“I’d come from a long ways off and had started a long ways down. But now
destiny was about to manifest itself. I felt like it was looking right at
me and nobody else.” So writes Bob Dylan in Chronicles: Volume One, his
remarkable book exploring critical junctures in his life and career.
Through Dylan’s eyes and open mind, we see Greenwich Village, circa 1961,
when he first arrives in Manhattan. Dylan’s New York is a magical city of
possibilities—smoky, nightlong parties; literary awakenings; transient
loves and unbreakable friendships. Elegiac observations are punctuated by
jabs of memories, penetrating and tough. With the book’s side trips to New
Orleans, Woodstock, Minnesota, and points west, Chronicles: Volume One is
an intimate and intensely personal recollection of extraordinary times. By
turns revealing, poetical, passionate, and witty, Chronicles: Volume One is
a mesmerizing window on Bob Dylan’s thoughts and influences. Dylan’s voice
is distinctively American: generous of spirit, engaged, fanciful, and
rhythmic. Utilizing his unparalleled gifts of storytelling and the
exquisite expressiveness that are the hallmarks of his music, Bob Dylan
turns Chronicles: Volume One into a poignant reflection on life, and the
people and places that helped shape the man and the art."

explain that the sisters were among the leading opponents of Gen. Rafael
Leonidas Trujillo’s dictatorship. It doesn’t have to. Everybody knows of
Las Mariposas—“The Butterflies.” In this extraordinary novel, the voices of
all four sisters—Minerva, Patria, María Teresa, and the survivor,
Dedé—speak across the decades to tell their own stories, from hair ribbons
and secret crushes to gunrunning and prison torture, and to describe the
everyday horrors of life under Trujillo’s rule. Through the art and magic
of Julia Alvarez’s imagination, the martyred Butterflies live again in this
novel of courage and love, and the human cost of political oppression."

Hematoi descend from the unions of gods and mortals, and the children of
two Hematoi-pure-bloods-have godlike powers. Children of Hematoi and
mortals-well, not so much. Half-bloods only have two options: become
trained Sentinels who hunt and kill daimons or become servants in the homes
of the pures. Seventeen-year-old Alexandria would rather risk her life
fighting than waste it scrubbing toilets, but she may end up slumming it
anyway. There are several rules that students at the Covenant must follow.
Alex has problems with them all, but especially rule #1: Relationships
between pures and halfs are forbidden. Unfortunately, she's crushing hard
on the totally hot pure-blood Aiden. But falling for Aiden isn't her
biggest problem-staying alive long enough to graduate the Covenant and
become a Sentinel is. If she fails in her duty, she faces a future worse
than death or slavery: being turned into a daimon, and being hunted by
Aiden. And that would kind of suck."

Electric, he led the company to year-after-year success around the globe,
in multiple markets, against brutal competition. His honest, be-the-best
style of management became the gold standard in business, with his
relentless focus on people, teamwork, and profits. Since Welch retired in
2001 as chairman and chief executive officer of GE, he has traveled the
world, speaking to more than 250,000 people and answering their questions
on dozens of wide-ranging topics. Inspired by his audiences and their
hunger for straightforward guidance, Welch has written both a philosophical
and pragmatic book, which is destined to become the bible of business for
generations to come. It clearly lays out the answers to the most difficult
questions people face both on and off the job. Welch's objective is to
speak to people at every level of an organization, in companies large and
small. His audience is everyone from line workers to MBAs, from project
managers to senior executives. His goal is to help everyone who has a
passion for success. Welch begins Winning with an introductory section
called ""Underneath It All,"" which describes his business philosophy. He
explores the importance of values, candor, differentiation, and voice and
dignity for all. The core of Winning is devoted to the real ""stuff"" of
work. This main part of the book is split into three sections. The first
looks inside the company, from leadership to picking winners to making
change happen. The second section looks outside, at the competition, with
chapters on strategy, mergers, and Six Sigma, to name just three. The next
section of the book is about managing your career—from finding the right
job to achieving work-life balance. Welch's optimistic, no excuses, get-it-
done mind-set is riveting. Packed with personal anecdotes and written in
Jack's distinctive no b.s. voice, Winning offers deep insights, original
thinking, and solutions to nuts-and-bolts problems that will change the way
people think about work."

Marjane Satrapi's memoir-in-comic strips of growing up in Iran during the

fourteen-year-old Marjane was leaving behind her home in Tehran, escaping
fundamentalism and the war with Iraq to begin a new life in the West. Here
we follow our young, intrepid heroine through the next eight years of her
life- an eye-opening and sometimes lonely four years of high school in
Vienna, followed by a supremely educational and heartwrenching four years
back home in Iran. Just as funny and heartbreaking as its predecessor -
with perhaps an even greater sense of the ridiculous inspired by life in a
fundamentalist state - PERSEPOLIS 2 is also as clear-eyed and searing in
its condemnation of fundamentalism and its cost to the human spirit. In its
depiction of the universal trials of adolescent life and growing into
adulthood - here compounded by being an outsider both abroad and at home,
and by living in a state where you have no right to show your hair, wear
make-up, run in public, date, or question authority - it's raw, honest, and

there's the monumental task of building a suitable resting place for Dad—a

2396,2396,"Loosely based on the Arthurian legend of the Holy Grail and the Fisher
King, ""The Waste Land,"" which first appeared in 1922, is a landmark work of
Modernist poetry. Containing hundreds of allusions and quotations from
other works, ""The Waste Land"" is marked by a disjointed structure which
moves between voices and imagery without a clear delineation for the
reader, a hallmark of Modernist literature. Arguably Eliot's most famous
work, the theme of the poem, as the title would suggest, is ultimately a
dire one, of disillusionment, despair, and death. Also included in this
collection is ""The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock"" a work which preceded
""The Waste Land"" having been first published in 1910. Regarded as the
beginning of Eliot's influential period, ""Prufrock"" was considered
idiosyncratic at first but with time has been recognized as an important
shift in poetry from the Romantic era to the Modernist one. ""The Wasteland
and Other Poems,"" which includes an additional twenty-three poems, collects
some of the most pivotal works of the Modernist literary movement, which
would establish Eliot as one of the most important poets of the 20th
century. This edition is printed on premium acid-free paper."

That day, a German bomb hit the station, and Polish Radio went off the air.

2431,2431,"'It is no accident that we see green almost wherever we look. It is no
accident that we find ourselves perched on one tiny twig in the midst of a
blossoming and flourishing tree of life; no accident that we are surrounded
by millions of other species, eating, growing, rotting, swimming, walking,
flying, burrowing, stalking, chasing, fleeing, outpacing, outwitting a We
are surrounded by endless forms, most beautiful and most wonderful, and it
is no accident, but the direct consequence of evolution by non-random
natural selection - the only game in town, the greatest show on Earth.'
Charles Darwin's masterpiece On the Origin of Species shook society to its
core on publication in 1859. Darwin was only too aware of the storm his
theory of evolution would provoke. But he would surely have raised an
incredulous eyebrow at the controversy still raging a century and a half
later. Evolution is accepted as scientific fact by all reputable scientists
and indeed theologians, yet millions of people continue to question its
veracity. In The Greatest Show on Earth Richard Dawkins takes on
creationists, including followers of 'Intelligent Design' and all those who
question the fact of evolution through natural selection. In this brilliant
tour de force he pulls together the incontrovertible evidence that
underpins it. Like a detective arriving on the scene of a crime, he sifts
through fascinating layers of scientific facts and disciplines to build a
cast-iron case: from the living examples of natural selection around us in
birds and insects; the 'time clocks' of trees and radioactive dating that
calibrate a timescale for evolution; the fossil record and the traces of
our earliest ancestors; to confirmation from molecular biology and
genetics. All of this, and much more, bears witness to the truth of
evolution. The Greatest Show on Earth comes at a critical time: systematic
opposition to the truth of evolution is now flourishing as never before,
especially in America. In Britain and elsewhere in the world teachers
witness insidious attempts to undermine the status of science in their
classrooms. Richard Dawkins provides unequivocal evidence that boldly and
comprehensively rebuts such nonsense. At the same time he shares with us
his palpable love of the natural world and the essential role that science
plays in its interpretation. Written with elegance, wit and passion, it is
hard-hitting, absorbing and totally convincing."

novels that includes 'A Clash of Kings' and 'A Storm of Swords'. As a
whole, this series comprises a genuine masterpiece of modern fantasy,
bringing together the best the genre has to offer. Magic, mystery,
intrigue, romance, and adventure fill these pages and transport us to a
world unlike any we have ever experienced. Already hailed as a classic,
George R. R. Martin's stunning series is destined to stand as one of the
great achievements of imaginative fiction. Long ago, in a time forgotten, a
preternatural event threw the seasons out of balance. In a land where
summers can last decades and winters a lifetime, trouble is brewing. The
cold is returning, and in the frozen wastes to the north of Winterfell,
sinister and supernatural forces are massing beyond the kingdom’s
protective Wall. At the center of the conflict lie the Starks of
Winterfell, a family as harsh and unyielding as the land they were born to.
Sweeping from a land of brutal cold to a distant summertime kingdom of
epicurean plenty, here is a tale of lords and ladies, soldiers and
sorcerers, assassins and bastards, who come together in a time of grim
omens. Here an enigmatic band of warriors bear swords of no human metal; a
tribe of fierce wildlings carry men off into madness; a cruel young dragon
prince barters his sister to win back his throne; and a determined woman
undertakes the most treacherous of journeys. Amid plots and counterplots,
tragedy and betrayal, victory and terror, the fate of the Starks, their
allies, and their enemies hangs perilously in the balance, as each
endeavors to win that deadliest of conflicts; the game of thrones."

of Rotterdam, a tiny child with a mind leagues beyond anyone else. He knew
he could not survive through strength; he used his tactical genius to gain
acceptance into a children's gang, and then to help make that gang a
template for success for all the others. He civilized them, and lived to
grow older. Then he was discovered by the recruiters for the Battle School.
For Earth was at war - a terrible war with an inscrutable alien enemy. A
war that humanity was near to losing. But the long distances of
interstellar space has given hope to the defenders of Earth - they had time
to train military geniuses up from childhood, forging them into an
irresistible force in the high-orbital facility called the Battle School.
That story is told in two books, Orson Scott Card's beloved classic Ender's
Game, and its parallel, Ender's Shadow. Now, in Shadow of the Giant, Bean's
story continues. Bean was the smallest student at the Battle School, but he
became Ender Wiggins' right hand, Since then he has grown to be a power on
Earth. He served the Hegemon as strategist and general in the terrible wars
that followed Ender's defeat of the alien empire attacking Earth. Now he
and his wife Petra yearn for a safe place to build a family - something he
has never known - but there is nowhere on Earth that does not harbor his
enemies - old enemies from the days in Ender's Jeesh, new enemies from the
wars on Earth. To find security, Bean and Petra must once again follow in
Ender's footsteps. They must leave Earth behind, in the control of the

bighearted heroine of Good in Bed who found her happy ending after her
mother came out of the closet, her father fell out of her life, and her ex-
boyfriend started chronicling their ex-sex life in the pages of a national
magazine. Now Cannie's back. After her debut novel -- a fictionalized (and
highly sexualized) version of her life -- became an overnight bestseller,
she dropped out of the public eye and turned to writing science fiction
under a pseudonym. She's happily married to the tall, charming diet doctor
Peter Krushelevansky and has settled into a life that she finds wonderfully
predictable -- knitting in the front row of her daughter Joy's drama
rehearsals, volunteering at the library, and taking over-forty yoga classes
with her best friend Samantha. As preparations for Joy's bat mitzvah begin,
everything seems right in Cannie's world. Then Joy discovers the novel
Cannie wrote years before and suddenly finds herself faced with what she
thinks is the truth about her own conception -- the story her mother hid
from her all her life. When Peter surprises his wife by saying he wants to
have a baby, the family is forced to reconsider its history, its future,
and what it means to be truly happy. Radiantly funny and disarmingly

Gandhi was born in Western India in 1869. He was educated in London and
later travelled to South Africa, where he experienced racism and took up
the rights of Indians, instituting his first campaign of passive
resistance. In 1915 he returned to British-controlled India, bringing to a
country in the throes of independence his commitment to non-violent change,
and his belief always in the power of truth. Under Gandhi's lead, millions
of protesters would engage in mass campaigns of civil disobedience, seeking
change through ahimsa or non-violence. For Gandhi, the long path towards
Indian independence would lead to imprisonment and hardship, yet he never
once forgot the principles of truth and non-violence so dear to him.

the definitive book on Lewis and Clark’s exploration of the Louisiana
Purchase, the most momentous expedition in American history and one of the
great adventure stories of all time. In 1803 President Thomas Jefferson
selected his personal secretary, Captain Meriwether Lewis, to lead a voyage
up the Missouri River to the Rockies, over the mountains, down the Columbia
River to the Pacific Ocean, and back. Lewis and his partner, Captain
William Clark, made the first map of the trans-Mississippi West, provided
invaluable scientific data on the flora and fauna of the Louisiana Purchase
territory, and established the American claim to Oregon, Washington, and
Idaho. Ambrose has pieced together previously unknown information about
weather, terrain, and medical knowledge at the time to provide a vivid
backdrop for the expedition. Lewis is supported by a rich variety of
colorful characters, first of all Jefferson himself, whose interest in
exploring and acquiring the American West went back thirty years. Next
comes Clark, a rugged frontiersman whose love for Lewis matched
Jefferson’s. There are numerous Indian chiefs, and Sacagawea, the Indian
girl who accompanied the expedition, along with the French-Indian hunter
Drouillard, the great naturalists of Philadelphia, the French and Spanish
fur traders of St. Louis, John Quincy Adams, and many more leading
political, scientific, and military figures of the turn of the century.
High adventure, high politics, suspense, drama, and diplomacy combine with
high romance and personal tragedy to make this outstanding work of
scholarship as readable as a novel."

it ironically, though it might seem that way. I once live-tweeted the

through the journey of her evolution as a woman (Sweet Valley High) of
color (The Help) while also taking readers on a ride through culture of the
last few years (Girls, Django in Chains) and commenting on the state of
feminism today (abortion, Chris Brown). The portrait that emerges is not
only one of an incredibly insightful woman continually growing to
understand herself and our society, but also one of our culture. Bad
Feminist is a sharp, funny, and spot-on look at the ways in which the
culture we consume becomes who we are, and an inspiring call-to-arms of all

returns to dazzle, captivate, haunt, and entertain with this third
collection of short fiction following Smoke and Mirrors and Fragile
Things—which includes a never-before published American Gods story, “Black
Dog,” written exclusively for this volume. In this new anthology, Neil
Gaiman pierces the veil of reality to reveal the enigmatic, shadowy world
that lies beneath. Trigger Warning includes previously published pieces of
short fiction—stories, verse, and a very special Doctor Who story that was
written for the fiftieth anniversary of the beloved series in 2013—as well
“Black Dog,” a new tale that revisits the world of American Gods, exclusive
to this collection. Trigger Warning explores the masks we all wear and the
people we are beneath them to reveal our vulnerabilities and our truest
selves. Here is a rich cornucopia of horror and ghosts stories, science
fiction and fairy tales, fabulism and poetry that explore the realm of
experience and emotion. In Adventure Story—a thematic companion to The
Ocean at the End of the Lane—Gaiman ponders death and the way people take
their stories with them when they die. His social media experience A
Calendar of Tales are short takes inspired by replies to fan tweets about
the months of the year—stories of pirates and the March winds, an igloo
made of books, and a Mother’s Day card that portends disturbances in the
universe. Gaiman offers his own ingenious spin on Sherlock Holmes in his
award-nominated mystery tale The Case of Death and Honey. And Click-Clack
the Rattlebag explains the creaks and clatter we hear when we’re all alone
in the darkness. A sophisticated writer whose creative genius is
unparalleled, Gaiman entrances with his literary alchemy, transporting us
deep into the realm of imagination, where the fantastical becomes real and
the everyday incandescent. Full of wonder and terror, surprises and
amusements, Trigger Warning is a treasury of delights that engage the mind,
stir the heart, and shake the soul from one of the most unique and popular
literary artists of our day."

3006,3006,"New York Times bestselling author of The Joy Luck Club Amy Tan brings us
her latest novel: a sweeping, evocative epic of two women's intertwined
fates and their search for identity—from the lavish parlors of Shanghai
courtesans to the fog- shrouded mountains of a remote Chinese village
Shanghai, 1912. Violet Minturn is the privileged daughter of the American
madam of the city's most exclusive courtesan house. But when the Ching
dynasty is overturned, Violet is separated from her mother in a cruel act
of chicanery and forced to become a ""virgin courtesan."" Half-Chinese and
half-American, Violet grapples with her place in the worlds of East and
West—until she is able to merge her two halves, empowering her to become a
shrewd courtesan who excels in the business of seduction and illusion,
though she still struggles to understand who she is. Back in 1897 San
Francisco, Violet's mother, Lucia, chooses a disastrous course as a
sixteen-year-old, when her infatuation with a Chinese painter compels her
to leave her home for Shanghai. Shocked by her lover's adherence to Chinese
traditions, she is unable to change him, despite her unending American
ingenuity. Fueled by betrayals, both women refuse to submit to fate and
societal expectations, persisting in their quests to recover what was taken
from them: respect; a secure future; and, most poignantly, love from their
parents, lovers, and children. To reclaim their lives, they take separate
journeys—to a backwater hamlet in China, the wealthy environs of the Hudson
River Valley, and, ultimately, the unknown areas of their hearts, where
they discover what remains after their many failings to love and be loved.
Spanning more than forty years and two continents, The Valley of Amazement
transports readers from the collapse of China's last imperial dynasty to
the beginning of the Republic and recaptures the lost world of old Shanghai
through the inner workings of courtesan houses and the lives of the
foreigners living in the International Settlement, both erased by World War
II. A deeply evocative narrative of the profound connections between
mothers and daughters, imbued with Tan's characteristic insight and humor,
The Valley of Amazement conjures a story of inherited trauma, desire and
deception, and the power and obstinacy of love."

ago, Sebastian Wroth was turned into a vampire against his will. Burdened
with hatred and alone for ages, he sees little reason to live. Until an
exquisite, fey creature comes to kill him, inadvertently saving him
instead. When Kaderin the Cold Hearted lost her two beloved sisters to a
vampire attack long ago, a benevolent force deadened her
sorrow—accidentally extinguishing all of her emotions. Yet whenever Kaderin
encounters Sebastian, her feelings—particularly lust—emerge multiplied. For
the first time, she’s unable to complete a kill. And when the prize of a
legendary month-long contest is powerful enough to change history, Kaderin
will do anything to win it for her sisters. Wanting only to win her,
forever, Sebastian competes as well, taking every opportunity—as they
travel to ancient tombs and through catacombs, seeking relics around the
world—to use her new feelings to seduce her. But when Kaderin is forced to
choose between the vampire she’s falling for and reuniting her family, how

Cryptonomicon, it is history, adventure, science, truth, invention, sex,

and decades with the power of a roaring tornado, upending kings, armies,
religious beliefs, and all expectations. It is the story of Daniel
Waterhouse, fearless thinker and conflicted Puritan, pursuing knowledge in
the company of the greatest minds of Baroque-era Europe, in a chaotic world
where reason wars with the bloody ambitions of the mighty, and where
catastrophe, natural or otherwise, can alter the political landscape
overnight. It is a chronicle of the breathtaking exploits of ""Half-Cocked
Jack"" Shaftoe -- London street urchin turned swashbuckling adventurer and
legendary King of the Vagabonds -- risking life and limb for fortune and
love while slowly maddening from the pox ... and Eliza, rescued by Jack
from a Turkish harem to become spy, confidante, and pawn of royals in order
to reinvent a contentious continent through the newborn power of finance. A
gloriously rich, entertaining, and endlessly inventive novel that brings a
remarkable age and its momentous events to vivid life -- a historical epic
populated by the likes of Samuel Pepys, Isaac Newton, William of Orange,
Benjamin Franklin, and King Louis XIV -- Quicksilver is an extraordinary
achievement from one of the most original and important literary talents of
our time. And it's just the beginning ..."

3289,3289,"Jamaica in 1665 is a rough outpost of the English crown, a minor colony
holding out against the vast supremacy of the Spanish empire. Port Royal,
Jamaica′s capital, a cut-throat town of taverns, grog shops, and bawdy
houses, is devoid of London′s luxuries; life here can end swiftly with
dysentery or a dagger in your back. But for Captain Edward Hunter it is a
life that can also lead to riches, if he abides by the island′s code. In
the name of His Majesty King Charles II of England, gold in Spanish hands
is gold for the taking. And law in the New World is made by those who take
it into their hands. Word in port is that the Spanish treasure galleon El
Trinidad, fresh from New Spain, is stalled in nearby Matanceros harbor
awaiting repairs. Heavily fortified, the impregnable Spanish outpost is
guarded by the blood-swiller Cazalla, a favorite commander of King Philip
IV himself. With the governor′s backing, Hunter assembles a roughneck crew
to infiltrate the enemy island and commandeer the galleon, along with its
fortune in Spanish gold. The raid is as perilous as the bloody legends of
Matanceros suggest, and Hunter will lose more than one man before he finds
himself on the island′s shores, where dense jungle and the firepower of
Spanish infantry are all that stand between him and the treasure. With the
help of his cunning crew, Hunter hijacks El Trinidad and escapes the deadly
clutches of Cazalla, leaving plenty of carnage in his wake. But his
troubles have just begun. . . ."

from an aspiring poet. A 19-year-old student sent Rilke some of his verses,
seeking an opinion of their worth. Rilke declined to offer a critique,
instead encouraging the student to rely upon his own inner judgment:
""Nobody can advise and help you, nobody. There is only one single means. Go
inside yourself."" This seemingly dismissive letter proved to be the first
of ten, written during a six-year period that coincided with an important
stage in Rilke's artistic development. The poet offered his young
correspondent further advice on developing a rich inner life as well as
guidance on broader philosophical and existential issues. These letters,
which explore many of the themes that later emerged in Rilke's best works,

brother to face justice. But Puller quickly discovers that his brother is
pursued by others who don't want him to survive. Puller is in turn pushed
into an uneasy, fraught partnership with another agent, who may have an
agenda of her own. They dig more deeply into the case together, and Puller
finds that not only are her allegiances unclear, but there are troubling
details about his brother's conviction . . . and someone out there doesn't
want the truth to ever come to light. As the nationwide manhunt for Robert
grows more urgent, Puller's masterful skills as an investigator and
strengths as a fighter may not be enough to save his brother-or himself."

Kirkus Best Book Jellicoe Road is a dazzling tale that is part love story,
part family drama, and part coming-of-age novel. Described by Kirkus
Reviews as “a beautifully rendered mystery” and by VOYA as “a great choice
for more sophisticated readers and those teens who like multifaceted
stories and characters.” Abandoned by her mother on Jellicoe Road when she
was eleven, Taylor Markham, now seventeen, is finally being confronted with
her past. But as the reluctant leader of her boarding school dorm, there
isn't a lot of time for introspection. And while Hannah, the closest adult
Taylor has to family, has disappeared, Jonah Griggs, the boy who might be
the key to unlocking the secrets for Taylor’s past, is back in town, moody
stares and all. In this absorbing story by Melina Marchetta, nothing is as
it seems and every clue leads to more questions as Taylor tries to work out
the connection between her mother dumping her; Hannah finding her; Hannah’s
sudden departure; a mysterious stranger who once whispered something in her
ear; a boy in her dreams; five kids who lived on Jellicoe Road eighteen
years ago; and the maddening and magnetic Jonah Griggs, who knows her
better than she thinks he does. If Taylor can put together the pieces of
her past, she just might be able to change her future."

3407,3407,"The #1 bestselling author of The Collectors and Simple Genius returns with
STONE COLD...an unforgetable novel of revenge, conspiracy, and murder that
brings a band of unlikely heroes face-to-face with their greatest threat.
Oliver Stone, the leader of the mysterious group that calls itself the
Camel Club, is both feared and respected by those who've crossed his path.
Keeping a vigilant watch over our leaders in Washington D.C., the Camel
Club has won over some allies, but it has also earned formidable enemies-
including those in power who will do anything to prevent Stone and his
friends from uncovering the hidden, secret work of the government.
Annabelle Conroy, an honorary member of the Camel Club, is also the
greatest con artist of her generation. She has swindled forty million
dollars from casino king Jerry Bagger, the man who murdered her mother. Now
he's hot on her trail with only one goal in mind: Annabelle's death. But as
Stone and the Camel Club circle the wagons to protect Annabelle, a new
opponent, who makes Bagger's menace pale by comparison, suddenly arises.
One by one, men from Stone's shadowy past are turning up dead. Behind this
slaughter stands one man: Harry Finn. To almost all who know him, Finn is a
doting father and loving husband who uses his skills behind the scenes to
keep our nation safe. But the other face of Harry Finn is that of an
unstoppable killer who inevitably sets his lethal bull's-eye on Oliver
Stone. And with Finn, Stone may well have met his match. As Annabelle and
the Camel Club fight for their lives, the twists and turns whipsaw, leading
to a finale that is as explosive as it is shattering. And when buried
secrets are at last violently resurrected, the members of the Camel Club
left standing will be changed forever. With unrelenting pacing, stunning
reversals, and two of the most compelling characters in modern fiction,
STONE COLD is David Baldacci writing at his breathtaking best."

3456,3456,"A wildly picaresque new novel from Jonas Jonasson, the author of the
internationally bestselling The 100-Year-Old Man Who Climbed Out the Window
and Disappeared In a tiny shack in the largest township in South Africa,
Nombeko Mayeki is born. Put to work at five years old and orphaned at ten,
she quickly learns that the world expects nothing more from her than to die
young, be it from drugs, alcohol, or just plain despair. But Nombeko has
grander plans. She learns to read and write, and at just fifteen, using her
cunning and fearlessness, she makes it out of Soweto with millions of
smuggled diamonds in her possession. Then things take a turn for the
worse.... Nombeko ends up the prisoner of an incompetent engineer in a
research facility working on South Africa's secret nuclear arsenal. Yet the
unstoppable Nombeko pulls off a daring escape to Sweden, where she meets
twins named Holger One and Holger Two, who are carrying out a mission to
bring down the Swedish monarchy...by any means necessary. Nombeko's life
ends up hopelessly intertwined with the lives of the twins, and when the
twins arrange to kidnap the Swedish king and prime minister, it is up to
our unlikely heroine to save the day—and possibly the world. In this wild
romp, Jonasson tackles issues ranging from the pervasiveness of racism to
the dangers of absolute power while telling a charming and hilarious story
along the way. In the satirical voice that has earned him legions of fans
the world over, Jonasson gives us another rollicking tale of how even the
smallest of decisions can have sweeping—even global—consequences."

3471,3471,"A New York Times Bestseller In latest bestseller, Atul Gawande shows what
the simple idea of the checklist reveals about the complexity of our lives
and how we can deal with it. The modern world has given us stupendous know-
how. Yet avoidable failures continue to plague us in health care,
government, the law, the financial industry--in almost every realm of
organized activity. And the reason is simple: the volume and complexity of
knowledge today has exceeded our ability as individuals to properly deliver
it to people--consistently, correctly, safely. We train longer, specialize
more, use ever-advancing technologies, and still we fail. Atul Gawande
makes a compelling argument that we can do better, using the simplest of
methods: the checklist. In riveting stories, he reveals what checklists can
do, what they can't, and how they could bring about striking improvements
in a variety of fields, from medicine and disaster recovery to professions
and businesses of all kinds. And the insights are making a difference.
Already, a simple surgical checklist from the World Health Organization
designed by following the ideas described here has been adopted in more
than twenty countries as a standard for care and has been heralded as ""the
biggest clinical invention in thirty years"" (The Independent)."

I met Marlboro Man, a mysterious cowboy with steely blue eyes and a

3563,3563,"Although Oscar Wilde (1854–1900) created a wide range of poetry, essays,
and fairy tales (and one novel) in his brief, tragic life, he is perhaps
best known as a dramatist. His witty, clever drama, populated by brilliant
talkers skilled in the art of riposte and paradox, are still staples of the
theatrical repertoire. An Ideal Husband revolves around a blackmail scheme
that forces a married couple to reexamine their moral standards —
providing, along the way, a wry commentary on the rarity of politicians who
can claim to be ethically pure. A supporting cast of young lovers, society
matrons, an overbearing father, and a formidable femme fatale continually
exchange sparkling repartee, keeping the play moving at a lively pace. ike
most of Wilde's plays, this scintillating drawing-room comedy is wise,
well-constructed, and deeply satisfying. An instant success at its 1895
debut, the play continues to delight audiences over one hundred years
later. An Ideal Husband is a must-read for Wilde fans, students of English
literature, and anyone delighted by wit, urbanity, and timeless
sophistication."

be surpassed as the twentieth century's greatest practitioner of the
classic horror tale."" -Stephen King Frequently imitated and widely
influential, Howard Philips Lovecraft reinvented the horror genre in the
1920s, discarding ghosts and witches and instead envisioning mankind as a
tiny outpost of dwindling sanity in a chaotic and malevolent universe. S.

master's fiction, from the early tales of nightmares and madness such as
""The Outsider"" to the overpowering cosmic terror of ""The Call of Cthulhu.""

3679,3679,"The instant New York Times bestseller from “queen of the geeks” Felicia
Day, You’re Never Weird on the Internet (Almost) is a “relentlessly funny
and surprisingly inspirational” (Forbes.com) memoir about her unusual
upbringing, her rise to internet stardom, and embracing her weirdness to
find her place in the world. When Felicia Day was a girl, all she wanted
was to connect with other kids (desperately). Growing up in the Deep South,
where she was “home-schooled for hippie reasons,” she looked online to find
her tribe. The Internet was in its infancy and she became an early adopter
at every stage of its growth—finding joy and unlikely friendships in the
emerging digital world. Her relative isolation meant that she could pursue
passions like gaming, calculus, and 1930’s detective novels without shame.
Because she had no idea how “uncool” she really was. But if it hadn’t been
for her strange background—the awkwardness continued when she started
college at sixteen, with Mom driving her to campus every day—she might
never have had the naïve confidence to forge her own path. Like when she
graduated as valedictorian with a math degree and then headed to Hollywood
to pursue a career in acting despite having zero contacts. Or when she
tired of being typecast as the crazy cat-lady secretary and decided to
create her own web series before people in show business understood that
online video could be more than just cats chasing laser pointers. Felicia’s
rags-to-riches rise to Internet fame launched her career as one of the most
influen­tial creators in new media. Ever candid, she opens up about the
rough patches along the way, recounting battles with writer’s block, a
full-blown gaming addiction, severe anxiety, and depression—and how she
reinvented herself when overachieving became overwhelming. Showcasing
Felicia’s “engaging and often hilarious voice” (USA TODAY), You’re Never
Weird on the Internet (Almost) is proof that everyone should celebrate what
makes them different and be brave enough to share it with the world,
because anything is possible now—even for a digital misfit."

behind nearly a million words of text, but his biography has long been a
thicket of wild supposition arranged around scant facts. With a steady hand
and his trademark wit, Bill Bryson sorts through this colorful muddle to
reveal the man himself. Bryson documents the efforts of earlier scholars,
from today's most respected academics to eccentrics like Delia Bacon, an

namesake, Francis Bacon, was the true author of Shakespeare's plays.
Emulating the style of his famous travelogues, Bryson records episodes in
his research, including a visit to a bunkerlike room in Washington, D.C.,
where the world's largest collection of First Folios is housed. Bryson
celebrates Shakespeare as a writer of unimaginable talent and enormous
inventiveness, a coiner of phrases (""vanish into thin air,"" ""foregone
conclusion,"" ""one fell swoop"") that even today have common currency. His
Shakespeare is like no one else's—the beneficiary of Bryson's genial

our time."

3780,3780,"Previously published as Ethics, Aristotle's The Nicomachean Ethics
addresses the question of how to live well, and originates the concept of
cultivating a virtuous character as the basis of his ethical system. This
Penguin Classics edition is translated from the Greek by J.A.K. Thomson
with revisions and notes by Hugh Tredennick, and an introduction and
bibliography by Jonathan Barnes. 'One swallow does not make a summer;
neither does one day. Similarly neither can one day, or a brief space of
time, make a man blessed and happy' In The Nicomachean Ethics, Aristotle
sets out to examine the nature of happiness. He argues that happiness
consists in 'activity of the soul in accordance with virtue', for example
with moral virtues, such as courage, generosity and justice, and
intellectual virtues, such as knowledge, wisdom and insight. The Ethics
also discusses the nature of practical reasoning, the value and the objects
of pleasure, the different forms of friendship, and the relationship
between individual virtue, society and the State. Aristotle's work has had
a profound and lasting influence on all subsequent Western thought about
ethical matters. Aristotle (384-22 BC) studied at the Academy of Plato for
20 years and then established his own school and research institute, 'The
Lyceum'. His writings, which were of extraordinary range, profoundly
affected the whole course of ancient and medieval philosophy and are still
eagerly studied and debated by philosophers today. If you enjoyed The
Nicomachean Ethics, you might like Plato's The Symposium, also available in
Penguin Classics."

religion vies with magic for the souls of the people. It is to this

Eva Fox is the princess of the Silver Demons Motorcycle Club. Growing up
with bikers in the club lifestyle is all that she knows. When she's a young

time and time again, but their twisted journey is filled with pain,
betrayal, and bloodshed that could tear them apart. Eva sees in Deuce what
he cannot see in himself—a man worthy of love—and Eva spends her lifetime
proving to him that her undeniable love is the one thing he can't live
without. This is Eva and Deuce's story. It wasn't easy. Nothing worth doing
ever is.And love is worth everything"

Stephen King You followed The Passage. You faced The Twelve. Now enter The
City of Mirrors for the final reckoning. As the bestselling epic races to
its breathtaking finale, Justin Cronin's band of hardened survivors await
the second coming of unspeakable darkness. The world we knew is gone. What

his transformation burns bright. His fury will be quenched only when he

rise against him. One last time light and dark will clash, and at last Amy
and her friends will know their fate. Praise for The City of Mirrors

Humans evolved to live in bands of roughly 150 individuals, the brain
cannot handle more than that number. If you have more than 150 Facebook
friends, they are surely not all real friends. Hindsight bias - When we
learn something new, we reassure ourselves that we knew it all along.
Confirmation bias - Our brains resist new ideas, instead paying attention
only to findings that reinforce our preconceived notions. Brand loyalty -
We reach for the same brand not because we trust its quality but because we
want to reassure ourselves that we made a smart choice the last time we
bought it. Packed with interesting sidebars and quick guides on cognition
and common fallacies, You Are Not So Smart is a fascinating synthesis of

God, he realized that God was answering them—directly—through Walsch’s pen.

have changed the lives of readers around the world. Here in one handsome
volume, with new introductions and afterwords, are the second two books in

pair discusses time, space, and politics. It is an honest look at some of
the broad issues important to all of us on the planet. Conversations with
God 3, the final book of the original three-book series, contains
“universal truths of the highest order, and the challenges and
opportunities of the soul.” In this volume, the dialogue expands to include
more about the nature of God, about love and fear, about who we are and who
we may become. Here is also a profound dialogue about the culture,

asked thousands of passersby for their dollars. When she became a singer,
songwriter, and musician, she was not afraid to ask her audience to support
her as she surfed the crowd (and slept on their couches while touring). And
when she left her record label to strike out on her own, she asked her fans
to support her in making an album, leading to the world's most successful

her fearlessness in asking for help, she finds that there are important
things she cannot ask for-as a musician, as a friend, and as a wife. She
learns that she isn't alone in this, that so many people are afraid to ask
for help, and it paralyzes their lives and relationships. In this
groundbreaking book, she explores these barriers in her own life and in the
lives of those around her, and discovers the emotional, philosophical, and

only to use your will power upon yourself."" Excerpt from chapter 1 - The
Right to be Rich Whatever may be said in praise of poverty, the fact
remains that it is not possible to live a really complete or successful
life unless one is rich. No man can rise to his greatest possible height in
talent or soul development unless he has plenty of money; for to unfold the
soul and to develop talent he must have many things to use, and he cannot
have these things unless he has money to buy them with. A man develops in
mind, soul, and body by making use of things, and society is so organized
that man must have money in order to become the possessor of things;
therefore, the basis of all advancement for man must be the science of
getting rich. The object of all life is development; and everything that
lives has an inalienable right to all the development it is capable of
attaining. Man's right to life means his right to have the free and
unrestricted use of all the things which may be necessary to his fullest
mental, spiritual, and physical unfoldment; or, in other words, his right
to be rich. In this book, I shall not speak of riches in a figurative way;
to be really rich does not mean to be satisfied or contented with a little.
No man ought to be satisfied with a little if he is capable of using and
enjoying more."

stood, and Michelle Maxwell left the Service under a similar cloud when she
lost a ""protectee"" to an ingenious kidnapping scheme, events told in
Baldacci's typical terse, fast-paced style in __. Now partners in a private
investigation firm in a small Virginia town, they're hired to investigate a
burglary at the home of a wealthy local family. But even before the chief
suspect in the break-in meets his death in a gruesome slaying reminiscent
of a serial killer long since caught and punished, King and Maxwell get
caught up in a string of other murders, each of which copies the techniques
of another madman, from San Francisco's Zodiac Killer to Chicago's infamous
John Wayne Gacy. While the two protagonists aren't especially complex or
well-developed, the action never stops, and Baldacci's trademark pacing
keeps the reader turning pages until the denouement, which unfortunately
isn't quite as satisfying as the rest of the novel. --Jane Adams Amazon.com
Exclusive Content Why Hour Game: An Exclusive Essay by David Baldacci Hour
Game, he went out of his way to create a murderous original. Read this
Amazon.com From Publishers Weekly Baldacci's last book, Split Second, was a
relatively weak offering from this bestselling author, sunk by a cartoonish
villain and absurd plot. But it did introduce two of Baldacci's (_Absolute
Power_, etc.) most memorable characters, former Secret Service agents Sean
King and Michelle Maxwell, in business together as private investigators in
smalltown Wrightsburg, Va. Baldacci is back in form, and King and Maxwell
reappear in this utterly absorbing, complex mystery-thriller that spins in
unexpected directions. The novel starts as a serial-killer thriller, for
there's a murderer at work in Wrightsburg whose selection of victims
appears random but whose modus operandi, differing from kill to kill,
mimics the work of a notorious serial killer—the Zodiac killer, John Wayne
Gacy, etc. The fifth victim is local resident and international tycoon
Robert E. Lee Battle. King and Maxwell have already been tangling with the
gothic horror show of a dysfunctional Southern family that is the Battles,
as they've been hired to help prove the innocence of a Battle handyman
accused of stealing from the family. Then that handyman is murdered, and
the duo (along with a clueless local sheriff and an obnoxious FBI agent)
must race to figure out if the same killer is behind all the murders and,
if so, why. There are terrific action sequences sprinkled throughout, and
plenty of suspense, and the King/Maxwell relationship, while not romantic,
emits sparks. It's Baldacci's portrayal of smalltown Southern life,
however, and his sharp characterizations of the Battles, from the bombastic
Bobby and his regal widow to his weird extended family, that give the novel
texture and depth: this is Baldacci's most accomplished tale since his
nonthriller Wish You Well, and it rivals that novel in its social
commentary. Despite fair clues, few if any readers will ID the villain
(villains?) before they're revealed, and a snappy surprise ending will have
Baldacci's many fans remembering why they love this author so much.

her engagement: that she agreed to marry the crown prince in exchange for
Arin's freedom. But can Kestrel trust Arin? Can she even trust herself? For
Kestrel is becoming very good at deception. She's working as a spy in the
court. If caught, she'll be exposed as a traitor to her country. Yet she
can't help searching for a way to change her ruthless world . . . and she
is close to uncovering a shocking secret. This dazzling follow-up to The
Winner's Curse reveals the high price of dangerous lies and untrustworthy
alliances. The truth will come out, and when it does, Kestrel and Arin will
learn just how much their crimes will cost them. The Winner's Crime by
Marie Rutkoski is the second book in the Winner's Trilogy. “The Winner's
Crime teeters on a knife-sharp edge between devastatingly romantic one
moment and simply devastating the next. Marie Rutkoski has captivated me
with her world of mind games, power struggles, and espionage, and left me
positively desperate to see how Kestrel and Arin's story will play out.”
—Marissa Meyer, New York Times-bestselling author of the Lunar Chronicles
series ""The middle entry in a fantasy trilogy brings new players to the
game while exponentially raising the stakes. . . . . The twisty plot is a
cleverly constructed puzzle box of intrigue and deceit, couched in graceful
prose that shifts from restrained to voluptuous. . . . Enthralling,
agonizing and incandescent."" —Kirkus Reviews, starred review “Brilliant
plotting and absolutely gorgeous writing combine to make The Winner's Crime
a standout, but it is the complex, deeply layered characters with their gut

was conquered and its citizens enslaved, leaving them without magic or a
monarch. Now the Winterians' only hope for freedom is the eight survivors
who managed to escape, and who have been waiting for the opportunity to
steal back Winter's magic and rebuild the kingdom ever since. Orphaned as
an infant during Winter's defeat, Meira has lived her whole life as a
refugee. Training to be a warrior—and desperately in love with her best
friend, Winter's future king—she would do anything to help Winter rise to
power again. So when scouts discover the location of the ancient locket

been, her own."
4139,4139,"""Born in 1941, Eileen Tumulty is raised by her Irish immigrant parents in
Woodside, Queens, in an apartment where the mood swings between heartbreak
and hilarity, depending on whether guests are over and how much alcohol has
been consumed. Eileen can't help but dream of a calmer life, in a better
neighborhood. When Eileen meets Ed Leary, a scientist whose bearing is
nothing like those of the men she grew up with, she thinks she's found the
perfect partner to deliver her to the cosmopolitan world she longs to
inhabit. They marry, and Eileen quickly discovers Ed doesn't aspire to the
same, ever bigger, stakes in the American Dream. Eileen encourages her
husband to want more: a better job, better friends, a better house, but as
years pass it becomes clear that his growing reluctance is part of a deeper
psychological shift. An inescapable darkness enters their lives, and Eileen
and Ed and their son Connell try desperately to hold together a semblance
of the reality they have known, and to preserve, against long odds, an idea
they have cherished of the future. Through the Learys, novelist Matthew
Thomas charts the story of the American Century, particularly the promise
of domestic bliss and economic prosperity that captured hearts and minds
after WWII. The result is a powerfully affecting work of art; one that
reminds us that life is more than a tally of victories and defeats, that we
live to love and be loved, and that we should tell each other so before the
moment slips away. Epic in scope, heroic in character, masterful in prose,
We Are Not Ourselves is a testament to our greatest desires and our

4201,4201,"From New York Times Best-Selling Author K. Bromberg comes the epic
conclusion of of Rylee and Colton's story... When life crashes down around
us, how hard are we willing to fight for the one thing we can’t live
without, each other? Life is full of moments. Big moments. Little moments.
And none of them are inconsequential. Every single moment prepares you for
that one instance that defines your life. You must overcome all your fears,
confront the demons that chase you, and cleanse the poison that clings to
your soul or you risk the chance of losing everything. Mine started the
minute Rylee fell out of that damn storage closet. She made me feel. Made
me whole when all I thought I could ever be was incomplete. Became the
lifeline I never knew I needed. Hell yes, she’s worth the fight...but how
do you fight for someone you know you don’t deserve? Love is full of ups
and downs. Heart stopping highs. Soul shattering lows. And none of them are
insignificant. Love is a racecourse of unexpected twists and turns that
must be negotiated. You have to break down walls, learn to trust, and heal
from your past in order to win. But sometimes it’s the expected that’s the
hardest to hold on to. Colton has healed and completed me, stolen my heart,
and made me realize our love’s not predictable nor perfect—it’s bent. And
bent’s okay. But when outside factors put our relationship to the test,
what lengths will I have to go to prove to him that he’s worth the fight?
Whoever said love is patient and love is kind, never met the two of us. We
know our love is worth it—have acknowledged that we were meant to be—but
when our pasts crash into our future, will the repercussions make us
stronger or break us apart?"

What will the future bring? And finally, why is there something rather than
nothing?” One of the few prominent scientists today to have crossed the
chasm between science and popular culture, Krauss describes the

theories that demonstrate not only can something arise from nothing,
something will always arise from nothing. With a new preface about the
significance of the discovery of the Higgs particle, A Universe from
Nothing uses Krauss’s characteristic wry humor and wonderfully clear
explanations to take us back to the beginning of the beginning, presenting
the most recent evidence for how our universe evolved—and the implications
for how it’s going to end. Provocative, challenging, and delightfully

4354,4354,"""Oh, screw it, let's do it."" That's the philosophy that has allowed Richard
Branson, in slightly more than twenty-five years, to spawn so many
successful ventures. From the airline business (Virgin Atlantic Airways),
to music (Virgin Records and V2), to cola (Virgin Cola), to retail (Virgin
Megastores), and nearly a hundred others, ranging from financial services
to bridal wear, Branson has a track record second to none. Losing My
Virginity is the unusual, frequently outrageous autobiography of one of the
great business geniuses of our time. When Richard Branson started his first
business, he and his friends decided that ""since we're complete virgins at
business, let's call it just that: Virgin."" Since then, Branson has written
his own ""rules"" for success, creating a group of companies with a global
presence, but no central headquarters, no management hierarchy, and minimal
bureaucracy. Many of Richard Branson's companies--airlines, retailing, and
cola are good examples--were started in the face of entrenched competition.
The experts said, ""Don't do it."" But Branson found golden opportunities in
markets in which customers have been ripped off or underserved, where
confusion reigns, and the competition is complacent. And in this stressed-
out, overworked age, Richard Branson gives us a new model: a dynamic,
hardworking, successful entrepreneur who lives life to the fullest. Family,
friends, fun, and adventure are equally important as business in Branson's
life. Losing My Virginity is a portrait of a productive, sane, balanced
life, filled with rich and colorful stories: Crash-landing his hot-air
balloon in the Algerian desert, yet remaining determined to have another go
at being the first to circle the globe Signing the Sex Pistols, Janet
Jackson, the Rolling Stones, Boy George, and Phil Collins Fighting back
when British Airways took on Virgin Atlantic and successfully suing this
pillar of the British business establishment Swimming two miles to safety
during a violent storm off the coast of Mexico Selling Virgin Records to
save Virgin Atlantic Staging a rescue flight into Baghdad before the start
of the Gulf War . . . And much more. Losing My Virginity is the ultimate
tale of personal and business survival from a man who combines the business
prowess of Bill Gates and the promotional instincts of P. T. Barnum. Also
available in the UK from Virgin Publishing, and in Canada from General
Publishing, From the Hardcover edition."

see the kid with his magical rat pipe. And they were amazing when the rats
followed hint out of town. They'd have been really amazed if they'd ever
found out that the rats and the piper met up with a cat somewhere outside

perfect Pied Piper scam. This streetwise alley cat knows the value of cold,

again, the Queendom of the Fells seems likely to shatter apart. For young
queen Raisa ana'Marianna, maintaining peace even within her own castle
walls is nearly impossible; tension between wizards and Clan has reached a

new American classic from the Pulitzer Prize-winning author of Gilead and
Housekeeping Marilynne Robinson, one of the greatest novelists of our time,
returns to the town of Gilead in an unforgettable story of a girlhood lived
on the fringes of society in fear, awe, and wonder. Lila, homeless and
alone after years of roaming the countryside, steps inside a small-town
Iowa church-the only available shelter from the rain-and ignites a romance
and a debate that will reshape her life. She becomes the wife of a
minister, John Ames, and begins a new existence while trying to make sense
of the life that preceded her newfound security. Neglected as a toddler,
Lila was rescued by Doll, a canny young drifter, and brought up by her in a
hardscrabble childhood. Together they crafted a life on the run, living
hand to mouth with nothing but their sisterly bond and a ragged blade to
protect them. Despite bouts of petty violence and moments of desperation,
their shared life was laced with moments of joy and love. When Lila arrives
in Gilead, she struggles to reconcile the life of her makeshift family and
their days of hardship with the gentle Christian worldview of her husband
which paradoxically judges those she loves. Revisiting the beloved
characters and setting of Robinson's Pulitzer Prize-winning Gilead and
Home, a National Book Award finalist, Lila is a moving expression of the
mysteries of existence that is destined to become an American classic."

historians at various points in time, it triggers a chain of events that

Markham's West with the Night is a true classic, a book that deserves the
same acclaim and readership as the work of her contemporaries Ernest
Hemingway, Antoine de Saint-Exupéry, and Isak Dinesen. If the first
responsibility of a memoirist is to lead a life worth writing about,
Markham succeeded beyond all measure. Born Beryl Clutterbuck in the middle
of England, she and her father moved to Kenya when she was a girl, and she
grew up with a zebra for a pet; horses for friends; baboons, lions, and
gazelles for neighbors. She made money by scouting elephants from a tiny
plane. And she would spend most of the rest of her life in East Africa as
an adventurer, a racehorse trainer, and an aviatrix—she became the first
person to fly nonstop from Europe to America, the first woman to fly solo
east to west across the Atlantic. Hers was indisputably a life full of
adventure and beauty. And then there is the writing. When Hemingway read
Markham's book, he wrote to his editor, Maxwell Perkins: ""She has written
so well, and marvelously well, that I was completely ashamed of myself as a
writer . . . [She] can write rings around all of us who consider ourselves
as writers . . . It is really a bloody wonderful book."" With a new
introduction by Sara Wheeler—one of Markham's few legitimate literary
heirs—West with the Night should once again take its place as one of the
world's great adventure stories."

4539,4539,"Discussed and debated from time immemorial, the concept of personal liberty
went without codification until the 1859 publication of On Liberty. John
Stuart Mill's complete and resolute dedication to the cause of freedom
inspired this treatise, an enduring work through which the concept remains
well known and studied. The British economist, philosopher, and ethical
theorist's argument does not focus on ""the so-called Liberty of the
Will…but Civil, or Social Liberty: the nature and limits of the power which
can be legitimately exercised by society over the individual."" Mill asks
and answers provocative questions relating to the boundaries of social
authority and individual sovereignty. In powerful and persuasive prose, he
declares that there is ""one very simple principle"" regarding the use of
coercion in society — one may only coerce others either to defend oneself
or to defend others from harm. The new edition offers students of political
science and philosophy, in an inexpensive volume, one of the most
influential studies on the nature of individual liberty and its role in a
democratic society."

4631,4631,"Soon to be a motion picture! The New York Times bestselling author hailed
as “the UK’s answer to Tina Fey, Chelsea Handler, and Lena Dunham all
rolled into one” (Marie Claire) makes her fiction debut with a hilarious
yet deeply moving coming of age novel. What do you do in your teenage years
when you realize what your parents taught you wasn’t enough? You must go
out and find books and poetry and pop songs and bad heroes—and build
yourself. It’s 1990. Johanna Morrigan, fourteen, has shamed herself so
badly on local TV that she decides that there’s no point in being Johanna
anymore and reinvents herself as Dolly Wilde—fast-talking, hard-drinking
Gothic hero and full-time Lady Sex Adventurer. She will save her poverty-
stricken Bohemian family by becoming a writer—like Jo in Little Women, or
the Bröntes—but without the dying young bit. By sixteen, she’s smoking
cigarettes, getting drunk and working for a music paper. She’s writing
pornographic letters to rock-stars, having all the kinds of sex with all
kinds of men, and eviscerating bands in reviews of 600 words or less. But
what happens when Johanna realizes she’s built Dolly with a fatal flaw? Is
a box full of records, a wall full of posters, and a head full of
paperbacks, enough to build a girl after all? Imagine The Bell Jar written
by Rizzo from Grease. How to Build a Girl is a funny, poignant, and
heartbreakingly evocative story of self-discovery and invention, as only
Caitlin Moran could tell it."

Miller weaves phenomenal characters and true-to-life spectacles into his

challenge readers to see life in a new way. He shows that one of the
greatest desires of every person is the desire for redemption, to have
brokenness repaired. Instead of the chaotic relationships, self-hatred,
wreckless consumerism, and anxiety that overrun a life without redemption,
Miller uncovers the beauty and power of the Gospel to fulfill one of our

friends to poaching competitors, from cultivating and sustaining a CEO
mentality to knowing the right time to cash in. His advice is grounded in
anecdotes from his own hard-earned rise—from cofounding the early cloud
service provider Loudcloud to building the phenomenally successful
Andreessen Horowitz venture capital firm, both with fellow tech superstar
Marc Andreessen (inventor of Mosaic, the Internet's first popular Web
browser). This is no polished victory lap; he analyzes issues with no easy
answers through his trials, including demoting (or firing) a loyal friend;
whether you should incorporate titles and promotions, and how to handle
them; if it's OK to hire people from your friend's company; how to manage
your own psychology, while the whole company is relying on you; what to do
when smart people are bad employees; why Andreessen Horowitz prefers
founder CEOs, and how to become one; whether you should sell your company,
and how to do it. Filled with Horowitz's trademark humor and straight talk,
and drawing from his personal and often humbling experiences, The Hard
Thing About Hard Things is invaluable for veteran entrepreneurs as well as
those aspiring to their own new ventures."

4744,4744,"Russell Brand learned early on to make a joke of fear and failure. From a
troubled childhood in industrial Essex, England, to his descent into
addictions to alcohol, drugs, and sex in the seamy underbelly of London,
Brand has seen his share of both and miraculously lived to tell the tale.
In My Booky Wook he leads readers on a rollicking journey through his
disastrous school career, his infamous antics on MTV, and his multifarious
sexual adventures. But this irreverent memoir is a story not simply of
struggle but also of redemption, a testament to the difficulty of
discovering what you want from life and the remarkable power of a bloody-
minded determination to get it. My Booky Wook is a giddy trip through the
brilliant mind of one of Britain's most valuable exports."

Performance artists Caleb and Camille Fang dedicated themselves to making
great art. But when an artist’s work lies in subverting normality, it can
be difficult to raise well-adjusted children. Just ask Buster and Annie
Fang. For as long as they can remember, they starred (unwillingly) in their
parents’ madcap pieces. But now that they are grown up, the chaos of their
childhood has made it difficult to cope with life outside the fishbowl of
their parents’ strange world. When the lives they’ve built come crashing
down, brother and sister have nowhere to go but home, where they discover
that Caleb and Camille are planning one last performance–their magnum
opus–whether the kids agree to participate or not. Soon, ambition breeds
conflict, bringing the Fangs to face the difficult decision about what’s
ultimately more important: their family or their art. Filled with Kevin
Wilson’s endless creativity, vibrant prose, sharp humor, and keen sense of
the complex performances that unfold in the relationships of people who

and cared for his son on the mean streets of San Francisco and went on to
become a crown prince of Wall Street At the age of twenty, Milwaukee native
Chris Gardner, just out of the Navy, arrived in San Francisco to pursue a
promising career in medicine. Considered a prodigy in scientific research,
he surprised everyone and himself by setting his sights on the competitive
world of high finance. Yet no sooner had he landed an entry-level position
at a prestigious firm than Gardner found himself caught in a web of
incredibly challenging circumstances that left him as part of the city's
working homeless and with a toddler son. Motivated by the promise he made
to himself as a fatherless child to never abandon his own children, the two
spent almost a year moving among shelters, ""HO-tels,"" soup lines, and even
sleeping in the public restroom of a subway station. Never giving in to
despair, Gardner made an astonishing transformation from being part of the
city's invisible poor to being a powerful player in its financial district.
More than a memoir of Gardner's financial success, this is the story of a
man who breaks his own family's cycle of men abandoning their children.

shivers more often than it purrs, so I call it Brrr instead."" —From Wicked
Since Wicked was first published in 1995, millions of readers have
discovered Gregory Maguire's fantastically encyclopedic Oz, a world filled
with characters both familiar and new, darkly conceived and daringly
reimagined. In the much-anticipated third volume of the Wicked Years, we
return to Oz, seen now through the eyes of the Cowardly Lion—the once tiny
cub defended by Elphaba in Wicked. While civil war looms in Oz, a tetchy
oracle named Yackle prepares for death. Before her final hour, an enigmatic
figure known as Brrr—the Cowardly Lion—arrives searching for information
about Elphaba Thropp, the Wicked Witch of the West. As payment, Yackle, who
hovered on the sidelines of Elphaba's life, demands some answers of her
own. Brrr surrenders his story to the ailing maunt: Abandoned as a cub, his
earliest memories are gluey hazes, and his path from infancy in the Great
Gillikin Forest is no Yellow Brick Road. Seeking to redress an early
mistake, he trudges through a swamp of ghosts, becomes implicated in a
massacre of trolls, and falls in love with a forbidding Cat princess. In
the wake of laws that oppress talking Animals, he avoids a jail sentence by
agreeing to serve as a lackey to the war-mongering Emperor of Oz. A Lion
Among Men chronicles a battle of wits hastened by the Emerald City's
approaching armies. What does the Lion know of the whereabouts of the
Witch's boy, Liir? What can Yackle reveal about the auguries of the Clock
of the Time Dragon? And what of the Grimmerie, the magic book that vanished
as quickly as Elphaba? Is destiny ever arbitrary? Can those tarnished by
infamy escape their sobriquets—cowardly, wicked, brainless, criminally
earnest—to claim their own histories, to live honorably within their own
skins before they're skinned alive? At once a portrait of a would-be
survivor and a panoramic glimpse of a world gone shrill with war fever,
Gregory Maguire's new novel is written with the sympathy and power that

pack-mule, was pushing through an arid stretch of country somewhere in
central New Mexico. He had lost his way, and was trying to get back to the
trail, with only his compass and his sense of direction for guides. The
difficulty was that the country in which he found himself was so
featureless-or rather, that it was crowded with features, all exactly
alike. As far as he could see, on every side, the landscape was heaped up
into monotonous red sand-hills, not much larger than haycocks, and very
much the shape of haycocks. One could not have believed that in the number
of square miles a man is able to sweep with the eye there could be so many
uniform red hills. He had been riding among them since early morning, and
the look of the country had no more changed than if he had stood still. He
must have travelled through thirty miles of these conical red hills,
winding his way in the narrow cracks between them, and he had begun to
think that he would never see anything else. They were so exactly like one
another that he seemed to be wandering in some geometrical nightmare;
flattened cones, they were, more the shape of Mexican ovens than haycocks-
yes, exactly the shape of Mexican ovens, red as brick-dust, and naked of
vegetation except for small juniper trees. And the junipers, too, were the
shape of Mexican ovens. Every conical hill was spotted with smaller cones
of juniper, a uniform yellowish green, as the hills were a uniform red. The
hills thrust out of the ground so thickly that they seemed to be pushing
each other, elbowing each other aside, tipping each other over."

Oblomov rarely changes out of his dressing gown, spending his days drifting

4796,4796,"One of the most influential books about children ever published,
NurtureShock offers a revolutionary new perspective on children that upends
a library's worth of conventional wisdom. With impeccable storytelling and
razor-sharp analysis, the authors demonstrate that many of modern society's
strategies for nurturing children are in fact backfiring--because key
twists in the science have been overlooked. Nothing like a parenting
manual, NurtureShock gets to the core of how we grow, learn and live.
Released in hardcover in September 2009, NurtureShock remained on the New
York Times best seller list for three months, and was one of Amazon's best
selling books for 2009. The book has become a worldwide phenomenon with
editions published around the world - in fifteen languages, to date. In
addition to Bronson and Merryman's writings on praise -- first made famous
in New York magazine -- there are nine more equally groundbreaking
chapters. Among the topics covered: Why the most brutal person in a child's
life is often a sibling, and how a single aspect of their preschool-aged
play can determine their relationship as adults. When is it too soon - or
too late - to teach a child about race? Children in diverse schools are
less likely to have a cross-racial friendship, not more - so is school
diversity backfiring? Millions of families are fighting to get their kids
into private schools and advanced programs as early as possible. But
schools are missing the best kids, 73% of the time - the new neuroscience
explains why. Why are kids - even those from the best of homes - still
aggressive and cruel? The answer is found in a rethinking of parental
conflict, discipline, television's unexpected influence, and social
dominance. Parents are desperate to jump-start infants' language skills.
Recently, scientists have discovered a series of natural techniques that
are astonishing in their efficacy - it's not baby videos, sign language, or
even the richness of language exposure. It's nothing you've heard before."

4879,4879,"An unforgettable firsthand account of a people's response to genocide and
what it tells us about humanity. This remarkable debut book chronicles what
has happened in Rwanda and neighboring states since 1994, when the Rwandan
government called on everyone in the Hutu majority to murder everyone in
the Tutsi minority. Though the killing was low-tech--largely by machete--it
was carried out at shocking speed: some 800,000 people were exterminated in
a hundred days. A Tutsi pastor, in a letter to his church president, a
Hutu, used the chilling phrase that gives Philip Gourevitch his title. With
keen dramatic intensity, Gourevitch frames the genesis and horror of
Rwanda's ""genocidal logic"" in the anguish of its aftermath: the mass
displacements, the temptations of revenge and the quest for justice, the
impossibly crowded prisons and refugee camps. Through intimate portraits of
Rwandans in all walks of life, he focuses on the psychological and
political challenges of survival and on how the new leaders of postcolonial
Africa went to war in the Congo when resurgent genocidal forces threatened
to overrun central Africa. Can a country composed largely of perpetrators
and victims create a cohesive national society? This moving contribution to
the literature of witness tells us much about the struggle everywhere to
forge sane, habitable political orders, and about the stubbornness of the
human spirit in a world of extremity. We Wish to Inform You That Tomorrow
We Will Be Killed with Our Families is the winner of the National Book

de Literatura y Pr�ncipe de Asturias de las Letras, Mario Vargas Llosa,
libera en esta novela una historia en la que el amor se nos muestra
indefinible, due�o de mil caras, como la ni�a mala. �Cu�l es el verdadero
rostro del amor? Ricardo ve cumplido, a una edad muy temprana, el sue�o que
en su Lima natal aliment� desde que ten�a uso de raz�n: vivir en Par�s.
Pero el rencuentro con un amor de adolescencia lo cambiar� todo. La joven,
inconformista, aventurera, pragm�tica e inquieta, lo arrastrar� fuera del
peque�o mundo de sus ambiciones. Testigos de �pocas convulsas y
florecientes en ciudades como Londres, Par�s, Tokio o Madrid, que aqu� son
mucho m�s que escenarios, ambos personajes ver�n sus vidas entrelazarse sin
llegar a coincidir del todo. Sin embargo, esta danza de encuentros y
desencuentros har� crecer la intensidad del relato p�gina a p�gina hasta
propiciar una verdadera fusi�n del lector con el universo emocional de los
protagonistas. Mario Vargas Llosa juega en Travesuras de la ni�a mala
(2006) con la realidad y la ficci�n para ilustrar la complejidad del amor:
pasi�n y distancia, azar y destino, dolor y disfrute... �Cu�l es el
verdadero rostro del amor? La cr�tica ha dicho... �Una novela de amor de
hoy, de erotismo, con encuentros, separaciones, sufrimientos, enga�os,
entrega, y tambi�n mucha verdad, y en la que Vargas Llosa, a modo de
entom�logo, analiza minuciosamente la condici�n humana, como su gran
admirado Flaubert en La educaci�n sentimental, obra que se cita en la
novela, entre otras muchas referencias literarias a las que alude el autor.
Y es que la idea de novela para Vargas Llosa es ""la experiencia
totalizadora de la condici�n humana"".� El Pa�s �La ni�a mala recuerda a los
amorosos de Sabines: buscan la felicidadsin nunca encontrarla, pues
encontrarla equivaldr�a a perderla sin remedio. Muy recomendable esta
novela, en apariencia modesta, pero que en realidad rasca con sa�a
exquisita en nuestros m�s �ntimos deseos y frustraciones dom�sticas.�

less than a human chain letter of kindness and good will. Does his plan
work? No. And yes -- it works wonderfully, but only after it has seemed to
Trevor that maybe all his efforts have been for naught. The first person he
chooses to help -- a homeless man to whom he gives his paper-route money so
he can make himself presentable enough to find a job -- disappoints him by
returning to a life of dissolution and eventually ending up in jail. The
second is a lady on his paper route, old and alone and infirm, and with a
garden that needs tending. No sooner has Trevor begun to help her, however,
than she goes and dies on him. The third person Trevor hopes to help is his
teacher, Reuben St. Clair, a scarred, bitter, untrusting man who seems to
come truly alive only when in front of his class. Trevor's goal is to match
him with his mother, Arlene, a pretty, hardworking woman who has raised
Trevor more or less alone, but who Trevor feels has a lot to offer the
right man. It proves not to be a match made in heaven, though, and Trevor's
dismay only deepens as he watches these two people come so close to
achieving the connection he wants for them, only to turn away at the last
moment. Failure seems inevitable, and Trevor is resigned. What he doesn't
realize, however, is that there really is a good side to human nature, and
that the tiny seed of kindness and caring he planted has taken root. In
neighborhoods in other California towns, and as far away as Los Angeles,
there are others following the rules of ""paying it forward."" Soon fame
comes knocking, bringing with it excitement and an unforeseen tragedy. In
the end, Pay It Forward is the story of seemingly ordinary people made
extraordinary by the simple faith of a child. In the tradition of the
successful and inspirational television show Touched by an Angel, and the
phenomenally successful novel and film Forrest Gump, Pay It Forward is a
work of charm, wit, and remarkable inspiration, a story of hope for today
and for many tomorrows to come."

be an inexperienced seventeen-year-old, but I'm grounded…sane. I look for
rational explanations to even the strangest circumstances. Since meeting

near, I feel an attraction to him–a magnetic kind of force pulling me
towards him. I know what you're thinking…that sounds fairly awesome. Yeah,
it would be…if he liked me, but Reed acts as if I'm the worst thing that

717 is a sanitation worker, a member of the lowest caste in her orchard
hive, where work and sacrifice are the highest virtues and worship of the
beloved Queen the only religion. But Flora is not like other bees. With
circumstances threatening the hive's survival, her curiosity is regarded as
a dangerous flaw, but her courage and strength are assets. She is allowed
to feed the newborns in the royal nursery and then to become a forager,
flying alone and free to collect nectar and pollen. A feat of bravery
grants her access to the Queen's inner sanctum, where she discovers
mysteries about the hive that are both profound and ominous. But when Flora
breaks the most sacred law of all—daring to challenge the Queen's
preeminence—enemies abound, from the fearsome fertility police who enforce
the hive's strict social hierarchy to the high priestesses jealously wedded
to power. Her deepest instincts to serve and sacrifice are now overshadowed
by a greater power: a fierce maternal love that will bring her into
conflict with her conscience, her heart, and her society—and lead her to
perform unthinkable deeds. Thrilling, suspenseful, and spectacularly

masterpieces are polite things; visions that soothe, charm and beguile, but
actually they are thugs. Merciless and wily, the greatest paintings grab
you in a headlock, rough up your composure, and then proceed in short order
to re-arrange your sense of reality. . . ."" With the same disarming force,
The Power of Art propels us on an eye-opening, breathtaking odyssey,
zooming in on eight extraordinary masterpieces, from Caravaggio's David and
Goliath to Picasso's Guernica. Jolting us far from the comfort zone of the
hushed art gallery, Schama closes in on intense make-or-break turning
points in the lives of eight great artists who, under extreme stress,
created something unprecedented, altering the course of art forever. The
embattled heroes—Caravaggio, Bernini, Rembrandt, David, Turner, Van Gogh,
Picasso and Rothko—each in his own resolute way, faced crisis with
steadfast defiance, pitting passion and conviction against scorn and short-
sightedness. The masterpieces they created challenged convention, shattered
complacency, shifted awareness and changed the way we look at the world.
With vivid storytelling and powerfully evocative descriptive passages,
Schama explores the dynamic personalities of the artists and the spirit of
the times they lived through, capturing the flamboyant theatre of bourgeois
life in Amsterdam, the passion and paranoia of Revolutionary Paris, and the
carnage and pathos of Civil War Spain. Most compelling of all, The Power of
Art traces the extraordinary evolution of eight ""eye-popping"" world-class
works of art. Created in a bolt of illumination, such works ""tell us
something about how the world is, how it is to be inside our skins, that no
more prosaic source of wisdom can deliver. And when they do that, they
answer, irrefutably and majestically, the nagging question of every
reluctant art-conscript . . . 'OK, OK, but what's art really for?'"""

In this episode, Brenner-forced out of the police force-tries to get away
from detective work by taking a job as the personal chauffeur for two-year-
old Helena, the daughter of a Munich construction giant and a Viennese
abortion doctor. One day, while Brenner's attention is turned to picking
out a chocolate bar for Helena at a gas station, Helena gets snatched from
the car. Abruptly out of a job, Brenner decides to investigate her
disappearance on his own. With both parents in the public eye, there's no
scarcity of leads-the father's latest development project has spurred
public protest, and the mother's clinic has been targeted by the zealous
leader of an anti-abortion group. Brenner and God is told with a dark humor
that leaves no character, including Brenner, unscathed. Haas tells the
story of a fallible hero who can be indecisive and world-weary, baffled and
disillusioned by what he finds, but who presses forward nonetheless out of
a stubborn sense of decency-a two-year-old is kidnapped, so you find her,

Pettigrew's Last Stand returns with a breathtaking novel of love on the eve
of World War I that reaches far beyond the small English town in which it
is set. East Sussex, 1914. It is the end of England's brief Edwardian
summer, and everyone agrees that the weather has never been so beautiful.
Hugh Grange, down from his medical studies, is visiting his Aunt Agatha,
who lives with her husband in the small, idyllic coastal town of Rye.
Agatha's husband works in the Foreign Office, and she is certain he will
ensure that the recent saber rattling over the Balkans won't come to
anything. And Agatha has more immediate concerns; she has just risked her
carefully built reputation by pushing for the appointment of a woman to
replace the Latin master. When Beatrice Nash arrives with one trunk and
several large crates of books, it is clear she is significantly more
freethinking--and attractive--than anyone believes a Latin teacher should
be. For her part, mourning the death of her beloved father, who has left
her penniless, Beatrice simply wants to be left alone to pursue her
teaching and writing. But just as Beatrice comes alive to the beauty of the
Sussex landscape and the colorful characters who populate Rye, the perfect
summer is about to end. For despite Agatha's reassurances, the unimaginable
is coming. Soon the limits of progress, and the old ways, will be tested as
this small Sussex town and its inhabitants go to war. Praise for The Summer

Klimt and his contemporaries found - or hoped to find - in beauty was
constantly overshadowed by death. And death therefore plays an important
role in Klimt's art. Klimt's fame, however, rests on his reputation as one
of the greatest erotic painters and graphic artists of his times. In

excellence, are dominated by the erotic portrayal of women. Klimt saw the

5149,5149,"FEATURED ON MORE THAN TWENTY BEST-OF LISTS, INCLUDING TIME, AMAZON, E! AND
PUBLISHERS WEEKLY! Hark! A Vagrant is an uproarious romp through history
and literature seen through the sharp, contemporary lens of New Yorker
cartoonist and comics sensation Kate Beaton. No era or tome emerges
unscathed as Beaton rightly skewers the Western world's revolutionaries,
leaders, sycophants, and suffragists while equally honing her wit on the
hapless heroes, heroines, and villains of the best-loved fiction. She
deftly points out what really happened when Brahms fell asleep listening to
Liszt, that the world's first hipsters were obviously the Incroyables and
the Merveilleuses from eighteenth-century France, that Susan B. Anthony is,
of course, a ""Samantha,"" and that the polite banality of Canadian culture
never gets old. Hark! A Vagrant features sexy Batman, the true stories
behind classic Nancy Drew covers, and Queen Elizabeth doing the albatross.
As the 500,000 unique monthly visitors to harkavagrant.com already know, no
one turns the ironic absurdities of history and literature into comedic
fodder as hilariously as Beaton."

5185,5185,"A good book may have the power to change the way we see the world, but a
great book actually becomes part of our daily consciousness, pervading our
thinking to the point that we take it for granted, and we forget how
provocative and challenging its ideas once were—and still are. The
Structure of Scientific Revolutions is that kind of book. When it was first
published in 1962, it was a landmark event in the history and philosophy of
science. Fifty years later, it still has many lessons to teach. With The
Structure of Scientific Revolutions, Kuhn challenged long-standing linear
notions of scientific progress, arguing that transformative ideas don’t
arise from the day-to-day, gradual process of experimentation and data
accumulation but that the revolutions in science, those breakthrough
moments that disrupt accepted thinking and offer unanticipated ideas, occur
outside of “normal science,” as he called it. Though Kuhn was writing when
physics ruled the sciences, his ideas on how scientific revolutions bring
order to the anomalies that amass over time in research experiments are
still instructive in our biotech age. This new edition of Kuhn’s essential
work in the history of science includes an insightful introduction by Ian
Hacking, which clarifies terms popularized by Kuhn, including paradigm and
incommensurability, and applies Kuhn’s ideas to the science of today.
Usefully keyed to the separate sections of the book, Hacking’s introduction
provides important background information as well as a contemporary
context. Newly designed, with an expanded index, this edition will be
eagerly welcomed by the next generation of readers seeking to understand
the history of our perspectives on science."

Novel Award, The Whitbread Book of the Year Award, and the Commonwealth

the BBC and Masterpiece/WGBH Boston. Hortense Joseph arrives in London from
Jamaica in 1948 with her life in her suitcase, her heart broken, her
resolve intact. Her husband, Gilbert Joseph, returns from the war expecting
to be received as a hero, but finds his status as a black man in Britain to

daughter, befriends Gilbert, and later Hortense, with innocence and
courage, until the unexpected arrival of her husband, Bernard, who returns
from combat with issues of his own to resolve. Told in these four voices,
Small Island is a courageous novel of tender emotion and sparkling wit, of
crossings taken and passages lost, of shattering compassion and of reckless

by Louisa May Alcott, is the third and final book in the Little Women
trilogy. Originally published in 1886, two years before Ms. Alcott's death,
Jo's Boys follows the lives of the young men readers came to love and
cherish in its prequel. In it, we learn the fates of Jo's sons Rob and
Teddy, along with the other boys at Plumfield Estate School. Written in
classic Alcott style, we see how the boys struggle to overcome their many
flaws, in the end learning life's lessons the hard way. Just as the March

the consequences of their actions. Readers will feel pain and joy along
side each young man as he completes his life journey and fulfills his
dreams in this classic conclusion to one of America's most beloved series.
LOUISA MAY ALCOTT (1832-1888), one of the most well-known American
novelists of the 19th century, was born on November 29, 1832 to
transcendentalist educator Amos Bronson Alcott and his wife, Abigail May
Alcott. She was the second of four sisters (like Jo, her literary
corollary), and grew up in a family that encouraged and sympathized with
her abolitionist and feminist leanings. As a child she received instruction
from noted literary figures such as Henry David Thoreau, Ralph Waldo
Emerson, Margaret Fuller, and Nathaniel Hawthorne, all family friends. In
addition to the Little Women series, which included four novels, she wrote
28 other works, three under the pen name A.M Barnard. Though Alcott had
chronic health problems in her later years, most likely attributed to an
autoimmune disease, she continued to write until her death at 55 in 1888."

usually involves doing what other people have overlooked as well as
avoiding what is unproductive. Intelligence, imagination, and knowledge may
all be wasted in an executive job without the acquired habits of mind that
mold them into results. Drucker identifies five practices essential to
business effectiveness that can, and must, be learned: Managing time
Choosing what to contribute to the organization Knowing where and how to
mobilize strength for best effect Setting the right priorities Knitting all
of them together with effective decision-making Ranging widely through the
annals of business and government, Peter F. Drucker demonstrates the

all things, wanted and unwanted, are brought to you by this most powerful
Law of the Universe: the Law of Attraction (that which is like unto itself,

Law of Attraction has been alluded to by some of the greatest teachers in
history, it has never before been explained in as clear and practical terms
as in this latest book by best-selling authors Esther and Jerry Hicks.
Here, you'll learn about the omnipresent Laws that govern this Universe and
how to make them work to your advantage. The knowledge that you'll absorb
from reading this book will take all the guesswork out of daily living.
You'll finally understand just about everything that's happening in your

detected by Libet). Clearly, findings of this kind are difficult to

debut, breaking out in wide scope and grand scale with a novel in the great
tradition of the war between good and evil in a wonderful fantasy world.
Modesitt had been producing fast-paced, slickly-written novels of SF
adventure, often compared to the work of Keith Laumer and Gordon R.
Dickson. Then, in his biggest and best book yet, he broadened his canvas
and turned to fantasy and magic, stepping immediately into the front rank
of contemporary fantasy writers. The Magic of Recluce is a carefully-
plotted fantasy novel of character about the growth and education of a
young magician. In it, Modesitt confronts real moral issues with gripping
force, builds atmosphere slowly and convincingly and gives his central
character, Lerris, real intellectual challenges. This is the kind of
highly-rationalized fantasy that Poul Anderson and Gordon R. Dickson write
when they write fantasy, colorful and detailed. He is given the standard
two options: permanent exile from Recluce or the dangergeld, a complex,
rule-laden wanderjahr in the lands beyond Recluce with the aim of learning
how the world works and what his place in it might be. Many do not survive.
He chooses dangergeld. Though magic is rarely discussed openly in Recluce,
it becomes clear, when Lerris is sent into intensive training for his
quest, that he has a natural talent for it during his weapons lessons. And
he will need magic in the lands beyond, where the power of the Chaos
Wizards reigns unchecked. He must learn to use his powers in an orderly way
or fall prey to Chaos. Lerris may resent order, but he has no difficulty
choosing good over evil. As he begins his lonely journey, he falls into the
company of a gray magician, once of Recluce, who tutors him in the use of
magic and shows him some of the devastation caused by the Chaos Wizards in
the great wars between Chaos and Order of past times. Lerris pursues a
quest for knowledge and power that leads him across strange lands, through
the ghostly ruins of the old capitol of Chaos, down the white roads of the
Chaos Wizards to a final battle with the archenemy of Order, discovering in
the end true control of magic, true love, and the beginning of true wisdom.
An epic adventure, The Magic of Recluce0, is a triumph of fantasy. The
Magic of Recluce is the first book of the saga of Recluce."

Only the dogged work of a pair of local newspapermen and a graduate student

5375,5375,"Just as Norman Maclean writes at the end of ""A River Runs through It"" that
he is ""haunted by waters,"" so have readers been haunted by his novella. A
retired English professor who began writing fiction at the age of 70,
Maclean produced what is now recognized as one of the classic American
stories of the twentieth century. Originally published in 1976, A River
Runs through It and Other Stories now celebrates its twenty-fifth
anniversary, marked by this new edition that includes a foreword by Annie
Proulx. Maclean grew up in the western Rocky Mountains in the first decades
of the twentieth century. As a young man he worked many summers in logging
camps and for the United States Forest Service. The two novellas and short
story in this collection are based on his own experiences—the experiences
of a young man who found that life was only a step from art in its
structures and beauty. The beauty he found was in reality, and so he leaves
a careful record of what it was like to work in the woods when it was still
a world of horse and hand and foot, without power saws, ""cats,"" or four-
wheel drives. Populated with drunks, loggers, card sharks, and whores, and
set in the small towns and surrounding trout streams and mountains of
western Montana, the stories concern themselves with the complexities of
fly fishing, logging, fighting forest fires, playing cribbage, and being a
husband, a son, and a father. By turns raunchy, poignant, caustic, and
elegiac, these are superb tales which express, in Maclean's own words, ""a
little of the love I have for the earth as it goes by."" A first offering
from a 70-year-old writer, the basis of a top-grossing movie, and the first
original fiction published by the University of Chicago Press, A River Runs
through It and Other Stories has sold more than a million copies. As Proulx
writes in her foreword to this new edition, ""In 1990 Norman Maclean died in
body, but for hundreds of thousands of readers he will live as long as fish
swim and books are made."""

the long-lost son of a prince. There was also a princess who had been
betrothed to him at birth. He was content with his life and his daydreams
until, one day, a stranger sold him a magic carpet. In this stunning sequel
to Howl's Moving Castle, Diana Wynne Jones has again created a large-scale,

seem. There are good and bad djinns, a genie in a bottle, wizards, witches,

5691,5691,"What happens when a respected Christian journalist decides to put his
preconceptions aside and take a long look at the Jesus described in the
Gospels? How does the Jesus of the New Testament compare to the ''new,
rediscovered' Jesus -- or even the Jesus we think we know so well? Best-
selling author Phillip Yancey says, 'The Jesus I got to know in writing
this book is very different from the Jesus I learned about in Sunday
school. In some ways he is more comforting; in some ways more terrifying.'
Yancey offers a new and different perspective on the life of Christ and his
work -- his teaching, his miracles, his death and resurrection -- and
ultimately, who he was and why he came. Relating the gospel events to the
world we live in today, The Jesus I Never Knew gives a moving and
refreshing portrait of the central figure of history. With a willingness to
tackle difficult questions, Yancey looks at the radical words of this
itinerant Jewish carpenter and asks whether we are taking him seriously
enough in our own day and age. From the manger in Bethlehem to the cross in
Jerusalem, Yancey presents a complex character who generates questions as
well as answers; a disturbing and exhilarating Jesus who wants to radically
transform your life and stretch your faith. The Jesus I Never Knew uncovers
a Jesus who is brilliant, creative, challenging, fearless, compassionate,
unpredictable, and ultimately satisfying. This honest book will help you
discover a different Jesus from the flannelgraph Sunday school figure, the
sweetly smiling Victorian Savior, and all the cultural clichés that have
tamed Jesus and kept him in comfortable religious boxes. According to
Yancey, 'No one who meets Jesus ever stays the same. In the end I found the
process of writing this book to be a great act of faith-strengthening.
Jesus has rocked my own preconceptions and has made me ask hard questions
about why those of us who bear his name don't do a better job of following
him.'"

5794,5794,"Rarely, if ever, does a new writer dazzle us with such a vivid imagination
and storytelling, flawlessly capturing the essence of a land, a people, a
legend. Conn Iggulden is just such a writer, bringing to vivid life one of
the most fascinating eras in human history. In a true masterpiece of
historical fiction, Iggulden takes us on a breathtaking journey through
ancient Rome, sweeping us into a realm of tyrants and slaves, of dark
intrigues and seething passions. What emerges is both a grand romantic tale
of coming-of-age in the Roman Empire and a vibrant portrait of the early
years of a man who would become the most powerful ruler on earth: Julius
Caesar. On the lush Italian peninsula, a new empire is taking shape. At its
heart is the city of Rome, a place of glory and decadence, beauty and
bloodshed. Against this vivid backdrop, two boys are growing to manhood,
dreaming of battles, fame, and glory in service of the mightiest empire the
world has ever known. One is the son of a senator, a boy of privilege and
ambition to whom much has been given and from whom much is expected. The
other is a bastard child, a boy of strength and cunning, whose love for his
adoptive family–and his adoptive brother–will be the most powerful force in
his life. As young Gaius and Marcus are trained in the art of combat–under
the tutelage of one of Rome’s most fearsome gladiators–Rome itself is being
rocked by the art of treachery and ambition, caught in a tug-of-war as two
rival generals, Marius and Sulla, push the empire toward civil war. For
Marcus, a bloody campaign in Greece will become a young soldier’s proving
ground. For Gaius, the equally deadly infighting of the Roman Senate will
be the battlefield where he hones his courage and skill. And for both, the
love of an extraordinary slave girl will be an honor each will covet but
only one will win. The two friends are forced to walk different paths, and
by the time they meet again everything will have changed. Both will have
known love, loss, and violence. And the land where they were once innocent
will be thrust into the grip of bitter conflict–a conflict that will set
Roman against Roman...and put their friendship to the ultimate test.
Brilliantly interweaving history and adventure, Conn Iggulden conjures a
stunning array of contrasts–from the bloody stench of a battlefield to the
opulence of the greatest city in history, from the tenderness of a lover to
the treachery of an assassin. Superbly rendered, grippingly told, Emperor,
The Gates of Rome is a work of vaulting imagination from a powerful new
voice in historical fiction. From the Hardcover edition."

5809,5809,"In January 1988, aged twelve, Martin Pistorius fell inexplicably sick.
First he lost his voice and stopped eating; then he slept constantly and
shunned human contact. Doctors were mystified. Within eighteen months he
was mute and wheelchair-bound. Martin's parents were told that an unknown
degenerative disease had left him with the mind of a baby and he probably
had less than two years to live. Martin went on to be cared for at centres
for severely disabled children, a shell of the bright, vivacious boy he had
once been. What no-one knew is that while Martin's body remained
unresponsive his mind slowly woke up, yet he could tell no-one; he was a
prisoner inside a broken body. Then, in 1998, when Martin was twenty-three
years old, an aromatherapy masseuse began treating him and sensed some part
of him was alert. Experts were dismissive, but his parents persevered and
soon realised their son was as intelligent as he'd always been. With no
memory of the time before his illness, Martin was a man-child reborn in a
world he didn't know. He was still in a wheelchair and unable to speak, but
he was brilliantly adept at computer technology. Since then, and against
all odds, he has fallen in love, married and set up a design business which
he runs from his home in Essex. Ghost Boy is an incredible, deeply moving
story of recovery and the power of love. Through Martin's story we can know
what it is like to be here and yet not here - unable to communicate yet
feeling and understanding everything. Martin's emergence from his darkness
enables us to celebrate the human spirit and is a wake-up call to cherish
our own lives."

ever felt both overworked and underutilised? Do you ever feel busy but not

an Essentialist. In Essentialism, Greg McKeown, CEO of a Leadership and
Strategy agency in Silicon Valley who has run courses at Apple, Google and
Facebook, shows you how to achieve what he calls the disciplined pursuit of
less. Being an Essentialist is about a disciplined way of thinking. It
means challenging the core assumption of âe~We can have it allâe(tm) and
âe~I have to do everythingâe(tm) and replacing it with the pursuit of
âe~the right thing, in the right way, at the right time'. By applying a
more selective criteria for what is essential, the pursuit of less allows
us to regain control of our own choices so we can channel our time, energy
and effort into making the highest possible contribution toward the goals
and activities that matter. Using the experience and insight of working
with the leaders of the most innovative companies and organisations in the

5972,5972,"THIS COLLECTION OF SHORT STORIES AND VIGNETTES MARKED ERNEST HEMINGWAY'S
AMERICAN DEBUT AND MADE HIM FAMOUS When In Our Time was published in 1925,
it was praised by Ford Madox Ford, John Dos Passos, and F. Scott Fitzgerald
for its simple and precise use of language to convey a wide range of
complex emotions, and it earned Hemingway a place beside Sherwood Anderson
and Gertrude Stein among the most promising American writers of that
period. In Our Time contains several early Hemingway classics, including
the famous Nick Adams stories ""Indian Camp,"" ""The Doctor and the Doctor's
Wife,"" ""The Three Day Blow,"" and ""The Battler,"" and introduces readers to
the hallmarks of the Hemingway style: a lean, tough prose -- enlivened by
an car for the colloquial and an eye for the realistic that suggests,
through the simplest of statements, a sense of moral value and a clarity of
heart. Now recognized as one of the most original short story collections
in twentieth-century literature, In Our Time provides a key to Hemingway's
later works."
5973,5973,"For two years, beginning in 1988, Jonathan Kozol visited schools in
neighborhoods across the country, from Illinois to Washington D.C., and
from New York to San Antonio. He spoke with teachers, principals,
superintendents, and, most important, children. What he found was
devastating. Not only were schools for rich and poor blatantly unequal, the
gulf between the two extremes was widening—and it has widened since. The
urban schools he visited were overcrowded and understaffed, and lacked the
basic elements of learning—including books and, all too often, classrooms
for the students. In Savage Inequalities, Kozol delivers a searing
examination of the extremes of wealth and poverty and calls into question
the reality of equal opportunity in our nation's schools."

6011,6011,"Nietzsche's famous attack upon established Christianity and religion is
brought to the reader in this inexpensive and compact edition of The
Antichrist, introduced and translated by H.L. Mencken. The incendiary tone
throughout separates this book from most other well-regarded philosophical
texts; even in comparison to Nietzsche's earlier works, the tone of
indignation and conviction behind each argument made is plain to see. There
is little by way of lofty ponderousness; the book presents its arguments
and points at a blistering pace, placing this book among the most
accessible and easily understood works of philosophy. The Antichrist
comprises a total of sixty-two short chapters, each containing a distinct
philosophical argument or angle upon the targets of Christianity, organised
religion, and those who masquerade as faithful but are in actuality
anything but. Pointedly opposed to the notions of Christian morality and
virtue, Nietzsche vehemently sets out a case for the faith's redundancy and
lack of necessity in human life. This edition contains the authoritative
introduction and translation of renowned journalist, author and Nietzsche
acolyte H.L. Mencken. Mencken's own native style shared similarities with
that of Nietzsche, and the two were strongly aligned philosophically. Over
a century later, it is this translation which remains the most

6055,6055,"Written with full cooperation from top management, including cofounders
Sergey Brin and Larry Page, this is the inside story behind Google, the
most successful and most admired technology company of our time, told by
one of our best technology writers. Few companies in history have ever been
as successful and as admired as Google, the company that has transformed
the Internet and become an indispensable part of our lives. How has Google
done it? Veteran technology reporter Steven Levy was granted unprecedented
access to the company, and in this revelatory book he takes readers inside
Google headquarters—the Googleplex—to show how Google works. While they
were still students at Stanford, Google cofounders Larry Page and Sergey
Brin revolutionized Internet search. They followed this brilliant
innovation with another, as two of Google’s earliest employees found a way
to do what no one else had: make billions of dollars from Internet
advertising. With this cash cow, Google was able to expand dramatically and
take on other transformative projects: more efficient data centers, open-
source cell phones, free Internet video (YouTube), cloud computing,
digitizing books, and much more. The key to Google’s success in all these
businesses, Levy reveals, is its engineering mind-set and adoption of such
Internet values as speed, openness, experimentation, and risk taking. After
its unapologetically elitist approach to hiring, Google pampers its
engineers—free food and dry cleaning, on-site doctors and masseuses—and
gives them all the resources they need to succeed. Even today, with a
workforce of more than 23,000, Larry Page signs off on every hire. But has
Google lost its innovative edge? With its newest initiative, social
networking, Google is chasing a successful competitor for the first time.
Some employees are leaving the company for smaller, nimbler start-ups. Can
the company that famously decided not to be evil still compete? No other
book has ever turned Google inside out as Levy does with In the Plex."

together a constellation of influences--biographical, historical, and
literary--to enrich each reader's understanding of these enduring works.
Hailed as “a Tolstoy with jokes"" by one critic, George Bernard Shaw was the
most significant British playwright since the seventeenth century.
Pygmalion persists as his best-loved play, one made into both a classic
film--which won Shaw an Academy Award for best screenplay--and the
perennially popular musical My Fair Lady . Pygmalion follows the adventures
of phonetics professor Henry Higgins as he attempts to transform cockney
flower girl Eliza Doolittle into a refined lady. The scene in which Eliza
appears in high society with the correct accent but no notion of polite
conversation is considered one of the funniest in English drama. Like most
of Shaw's work, Pygmalion wins over audiences with wit, a taut morality,
and an innate understanding of human relationships. This volume also
includes Major Barbara, which attacks both capitalism and charitable
organizations, The Doctor's Dilemma, a keen-eyed examination of medical
morals and malpractice, and Heartbreak House, which exposes the spiritual
bankruptcy of the generation responsible for the bloodshed of World War I.
John A. Bertolini is Ellis Professor of the Liberal Arts at Middlebury
College, where he teaches dramatic literature, Shakespeare, and film. He
has written The Playwrighting Self of Bernard Shaw and articles on
Hitchcock, and British and American dramatists. Bertolini also wrote the

6127,6127,"In his ""most accomplished work to date"" (Los Angeles Times), master of
historical fiction Robert Harris lures readers back in time to the
compelling life of Roman Senator Marcus Cicero. The re-creation of a
vanished biography written by his household slave and right-hand man, Tiro,
Imperium follows Cicero's extraordinary struggle to attain supreme power in
Rome. On a cold November morning, Tiro opens the door to find a terrified,
bedraggled stranger begging for help. Once a Sicilian aristocrat, the man
was robbed by the corrupt Roman governor, Verres, who is now trying to
convict him under false pretenses and sentence him to a violent death. The
man claims that only the great senator Marcus Cicero, one of Rome's most
ambitious lawyers and spellbinding orators, can bring him justice in a
crooked society manipulated by the villainous governor. But for Cicero, it
is a chance to prove himself worthy of absolute power. What follows is one
of the most gripping courtroom dramas in history, and the beginning of a
quest for political glory by a man who fought his way to the top using only
his voice -- defeating the most daunting figures in Roman history."

the green and kindly island that had become his adopted country. The
hilarious book that resulted, Notes from a Small Island, was taken to the
nationâe(tm)s heart and became the bestselling travel book ever, and was
also voted in a BBC poll the book that best represents Britain.Now, to mark
the twentieth anniversary of that modern classic, Bryson makes a brand-new
journey round Britain to see what has changed. Following (but not too
closely) a route he dubs the Bryson Line, from Bognor Regis to Cape Wrath,
by way of places that many people never get to at all, Bryson sets out to
rediscover the wondrously beautiful, magnificently eccentric, endearingly
unique country that he thought he knew but doesnâe(tm)t altogether
recognize any more. Yet, despite Britainâe(tm)s occasional failings and
more or less eternal bewilderments, Bill Bryson is still pleased to call
our rainy island home. And not just because of the cream teas, a noble
history, and an extra day off at Christmas. Once again, with his matchless
homing instinct for the funniest and quirkiest, his unerring eye for the
idiotic, the endearing, the ridiculous and the scandalous, Bryson gives us
an acute and perceptive insight into all that is best and worst about
Britain today."

meeting all the way up to sophisticated techniques used by the big winners
in life. In this information-packed book you’ll find: 9 ways to make a
dynamite first impression 14 ways to master small talk, ""big talk,"" and
body language 14 ways to walk and talk like a VIP or celebrity 6 ways to
sound like an insider in any crowd 7 ways to establish deep subliminal

ways to make your phone a powerful communications tool 15 ways to work a

listen more than they speak, feels alone in large groups, and requires lots

the book to help them boost their confidence while learning strategies for
successfully living in an extrovert world. After dispelling common myths
about introverts-they're not necessarily shy, aloof, or antisocial--The
Introvert Advantage explains the real issues. Introverts are hardwired from
birth to focus inward, so outside stimulation-chitchat, phone calls,
parties, office meetings-can easily become ""too much."" The Introvert
Advantage dispels introverts' belief that something is wrong with them and
instead helps them recognize their inner strengths-their analytical skills,
ability to think outside the box, and strong powers of concentration. It
helps readers understand introversion and shows them how to determine where
they fall on the introvert/extrovert continuum. It provides tools to
improve relationships with partners, kids, colleagues, and friends,
offering dozens of tips, including 10 ways to talk less and communicate
more, 8 ways to showcase your abilities at work, how to take a child's
temperament temperature, and strategies for socializing. Finally, it shows
how to not just survive, but thrive-how to take advantage of the
introvert's special qualities to create a life that's just right for the
introvert temperament, to discover new ways to expand their energy
reserves, and even how, when necessary, to confidently become a temporary
extrovert."

has always been Beth Cassidy's best friend and trusted lieutenant. Beth
calls the shots and Addy carries them out, a long-established order of
things that has brought them to the pinnacle of their high-school careers.
Now they're seniors who rule the intensely competitive cheer squad, feared
and followed by the other girls -- until the young new coach arrives. Cool
and commanding, an emissary from the adult world just beyond their reach,
Coach Colette French draws Addy and the other cheerleaders into her life.
Only Beth, unsettled by the new regime, remains outside Coach's golden

police investigation on Coach and her squad. After the first wave of shock
and grief, Addy tries to uncover the truth behind the death -- and learns
that the boundary between loyalty and love can be dangerous terrain. The
raw passions of girlhood are brought to life in this taut, unflinching

Award — one of the most admired and controversial public intellectuals of
our time — shares his personal life story. Most who have observed
Christopher Hitchens over the years would agree that he possesses a
ferocious intellect and is unafraid to tackle the most contentious
subjects. Now 60, English-born and American by adoption; all atheist and
partly Jewish; bohemian (even listing ""drinking"" along with ""disputation""
as ""hobbies"" in Who's Who), he has held to a consistent thread of principle
whether opposing war in Vietnam or supporting intervention in Iraq. As a
foreign correspondent in some of the world's nastiest places, a lecturer
and teacher and an esteemed literary critic, Hitchens manifests a style
that is at once ironic, witty, and tough-minded. A legendary bon vivant
with an unquenchable thirst for literature, he has sometimes ridiculed
those who claim that the personal is political, though he has often seemed
to illustrate that very idea. Readers will find that his own many opposites
attract, as do his many sketches of friendship and ex-friendship, from
Martin Amis to Noam Chomsky. Condemned to be able to see both sides of any
argument, Christopher Hitchens has contradictions that contain their own

intriguing mysteries. Originally commissioned in 1701 by Frederick I of
Prussia, the Room was later perfected Tsarskoe Selo, the Russian imperial
city. In 1941, German troops invaded the Soviet Union, looting everything
in their wake and seizing the Amber Room. When the Allies began the bombing
of Germany in August 1944, the Room was hidden. And despite the best
efforts of treasure hunters and art collectors from around the world, it
has never been seen again. Now, two powerful men have set their best
operatives loose in pursuit, and the hunt has begun once more. . . . Life
is good for Atlanta judge Rachel Cutler. She loves her job, loves her kids,
and remains civil to her ex-husband, Paul. But everything changes when her
father, a man who survived the horrors of World War II, dies under strange
circumstances—and leaves behind clues to a secret he kept his entire life .
. . a secret about something called the Amber Room. Desperate to know the
truth about her father's suspicious dealings, Rachel takes off for Germany,
with Paul close behind. Shortly after arriving, they find themselves
involved with a cast of shadowy characters who all claim to share their
quest. But as they learn more about the history of the treasure they seek,
Rachel and Paul realize they're in way over their heads. Locked in a
treacherous game with ruthless professional killers and embroiled in a
treasure hunt of epic proportions, Rachel and Paul suddenly find themselves
on a collision course with the forces of power, evil, and history itself. A
brilliant adventure and a scintillating tale of intrigue, deception, art,
and murder, The Amber Room is a classic tale of suspense—and the debut of a

her and her sisters into hiding fifteen years ago. One day a belligerent

damages turns into a war of bricks, bullets, and threats as he unleashes

March 2013, Italy's highest court annulled the acquittal and sent the case
to the lower courts for further proceedings. Even though no new evidence
was introduced against her, Amanda was found guilty and sentenced to
twenty-eight and a half years in prison in January 2014. This decision was
overturned by the Italian Supreme Court, which exonerated her of the murder
charge. In Waiting to Be Heard, Amanda speaks about what it was like to
find herself imprisoned in a foreign country for a crime she did not
commit, and how much she relied on the unwavering support of her family and
friends, many of whom made extraordinary sacrifices on her behalf. Waiting
to Be Heard is an unflinching, heartfelt coming-of-age narrative like no
other—now with a new afterword, in which Amanda describes the heart-
stopping final twists in her fight for freedom—and her hopes for the
future."

6415,6415,"One book. Two readers. A world of mystery, menace, and desire. A young
woman picks up a book left behind by a stranger. Inside it are his margin
notes, which reveal a reader entranced by the story and by its mysterious
author. She responds with notes of her own, leaving the book for the
stranger, and so begins an unlikely conversation that plunges them both
into the unknown. The book: Ship of Theseus, the final novel by a prolific
but enigmatic writer named V.M. Straka, in which a man with no past is
shanghaied onto a strange ship with a monstrous crew and launched onto a
disorienting and perilous journey. The writer: Straka, the incendiary and
secretive subject of one of the world's greatest mysteries, a revolutionary
about whom the world knows nothing apart from the words he wrote and the
rumors that swirl around him. The readers: Jennifer and Eric, a college
senior and a disgraced grad student, both facing crucial decisions about
who they are, who they might become, and how much they're willing to trust
another person with their passions, hurts, and fears. S., conceived by
filmmaker J. J. Abrams and written by award-winning novelist Doug Dorst, is
the chronicle of two readers finding each other in the margins of a book
and enmeshing themselves in a deadly struggle between forces they don't
understand, and it is also Abrams and Dorst's love letter to the written

earliest days, Patsy Jefferson knows that though her father loves his
family dearly, his devotion to his country runs deeper still. As Thomas
Jefferson’s oldest daughter, she becomes his helpmate, protector, and
constant companion in the wake of her mother’s death, traveling with him
when he becomes America’s minister to France. It is in Paris, at the
glittering court and among the first tumultuous days of the French
Revolution, that fifteen-year-old Patsy learns about her father’s troubling
liaison with Sally Hemings, a slave girl her own age. Meanwhile, Patsy has
fallen in love—with her father’s protégé, William Short, a staunch
abolitionist and ambitious diplomat. Torn between love, principles, and the
bonds of family, Patsy questions if she can choose a life as William’s wife
and still be a devoted daughter. Her choice will follow her in the years to
come—to Virginia farmland, to Monticello, and even to the White House. And
as scandal, tragedy, and poverty threaten her family, Patsy must decide how
much she will sacrifice to protect her father’s reputation, in the process
defining not just Jefferson’s political legacy but that of the nation he
founded. “Delectable and poignant. . . . You’re going to want to savor this

turned phrases in the English language.”—Ben Schott Follow the adventures
of Bertie Wooster and his gentleman’s gentleman, Jeeves, in this stunning
new edition of one of the greatest comic novels in the English language.
When Aunt Dahlia demands that Bertie Wooster help her dupe an antique
dealer into selling her an 18th-century cow-creamer. Dahlia trumps Bertie's
objections by threatening to sever his standing invitation to her house for
lunch, an unthinkable prospect given Bertie's devotion to the cooking of
her chef, Anatole. A web of complications grows as Bertie's pal Gussie
Fink-Nottle asks for counseling in the matter of his impending marriage to
Madeline Bassett. It seems Madeline isn't his only interest; Gussie also
wants to study the effects of a full moon on the love life of newts. Added
to the cast of eccentrics are Roderick Spode, leader of a fascist
organization called the Saviors of Britain, who also wants that cow-
creamer, and an unusual man of the cloth known as Rev. H. P. ""Stinker""
Pinker. As usual, butler Jeeves becomes a focal point for all the plots and
ploys of these characters, and in the end only his cleverness can rescue
Bertie from being arrested, lynched, and engaged by mistake!"

6514,6514,"The central principles of what today is broadly known as political
liberalism were made current in large part by Locke's ""Second Treatise of
Government"" (1690). The principles of individual liberty, the rule of law,
government by consent of the people, and the right to private property are
taken for granted as fundamental to the human condition now. Most liberal
theorists writing today look back to Locke as the source of their ideas.
Some maintain that religious fundamentalism, ""post-modernism,"" and
socialism are today the only remaining ideological threats to liberalism.
To the extent that this is true, these ideologies are ultimately attacks on
the ideas that Locke, arguably more than any other, helped to make the
universal vocabulary of political discourse."
6515,6515,"Can guys and girls ever really be just friends? Find out in Elizabeth
Eulberg's romantic comedy, now in paperback! For Macallan and Levi, it was
friends at first sight. Everyone says guys and girls can't be just friends,
but these two are. They hang out after school, share tons of inside jokes,
their families are super close, and Levi even starts dating one of Mac's
friends. They are platonic and happy that way. Eventually they realize
they're best friends -- which wouldn't be so bad if they didn't keep
getting in each other's way. Guys won't ask Mac out because they think
she's with Levi, and Levi spends too much time joking around with Mac, and
maybe not enough time with his date. They can't help but wonder . . . are
they more than friends or are they better off without making it even more
complicated? From romantic comedy superstar Elizabeth Eulberg comes a
fresh, fun examination of a question for the ages: Can guys and girls ever
really be just friends? Or are they always one fight away from not speaking
again -- and one kiss away from true love?"

MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR. brings to life a remarkable man whose thoughts and
actions speak to our most burning contemporary issues and still inspire the
desires, hopes, and dreams of us all. Written in his own words, this
history-making autobiography is Martin Luther King: the mild-mannered,
inquisitive child and student who chafed under and eventually rebelled
against segregation; the dedicated young minister who continually
questioned the depths of his faith and the limits of his wisdom; the loving
husband and father who sought to balance his family's needs with those of a
growing, nationwide movement; and the reflective, world-famous leader who
was fired by a vision of equality for people everywhere. Relevant and
insightful, THE AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR. offers King's
seldom disclosed views on some of the world's greatest and most
controversial figures: John F. Kennedy, Malcolm X, Lyndon B. Johnson,
Mahatma Gandhi, and Richard Nixon. It also paints a rich and moving
portrait of a people, a time, and a nation in the face of powerful change.
Finally, it shows how everyday Americans from all walks of life confronted
themselves, each other, and the burden of the past-and how their fears and
courage helped shape our future."

Condensed Edition The Road to Serfdom is a book written by the Austrian-
born economist and philosopher Friedrich von Hayek (1899-1992) between
1940-1943, in which he ""[warns] of the danger of tyranny that inevitably
results from government control of economic decision-making through central
planning."" He further argues that the abandonment of individualism and
classical liberalism inevitably leads to a loss of freedom, the creation of
an oppressive society, the tyranny of a dictator, and the serfdom of the
individual. Significantly, Hayek challenged the general view among British
academics that fascism (and National Socialism) was a capitalist reaction
against socialism. He argued that fascism, National Socialism and socialism
had common roots in central economic planning and empowering the state over
the individual. Since its publication in 1944, The Road to Serfdom has been
an influential and popular exposition of market libertarianism. It has sold
over two million copies. The Road to Serfdom was to be the popular edition
of the second volume of Hayek's treatise entitled ""The Abuse and Decline of
Reason,"" and the title was inspired by the writings of the 19th century
French classical liberal thinker Alexis de Tocqueville on the ""road to
servitude."" The book was first published in Britain by Routledge in March
1944, during World War II, and was quite popular, leading Hayek to call it
""that unobtainable book,"" also due in part to wartime paper rationing. It
was published in the United States by the University of Chicago Press in
September 1944 and achieved great popularity. At the arrangement of editor
Max Eastman, the American magazine Reader's Digest published an abridged
version in April 1945, enabling The Road to Serfdom to reach a wider
popular audience beyond academics. The Road to Serfdom has had a
significant impact on twentieth-century conservative and libertarian
economic and political discourse, and is often cited today by commentators."

Canto creates a resonant portrait of a life in this collection of writings
on love, friendship, work, and art. ""The tricky thing about being a writer,
or about being any kind of artist, is that in addition to making art you
also have to make a living."" So begins This Is the Story of a Happy
Marriage, an examination of the things Ann Patchett is fully committed
to—the art and craft of writing, the depths of friendship, an elderly dog,
and one spectacular nun. Writing nonfiction, which started off as a means
of keeping her insufficiently lucrative fiction afloat, evolved over time
to be its own kind of art, the art of telling the truth as opposed to the
art of making things up. Bringing her narrative gifts to bear on her own
life, Patchett uses insight and compassion to turn very personal
experiences into stories that will resonate with every reader. These essays
twine to create both a portrait of life and a philosophy of life. Obstacles
that at first appear insurmountable—scaling a six-foot wall in order to
join the Los Angeles Police Department, opening an independent bookstore,
and sitting down to write a novel—are eventually mastered with quiet
tenacity and a sheer force of will. The actual happy marriage, which was
the one thing she felt she wasn't capable of, ultimately proves to be a
metaphor as well as a fact: Patchett has devoted her life to the people and
ideals she loves the most. An irresistible blend of literature and memoir,
This Is the Story of a Happy Marriage is a unique examination of the heart,
mind, and soul of one of our most revered and gifted writers."

and question everything they ever believed… THIS IS A STORY ABOUT SACRIFICE
. . . DEATH . . . LOVE . . . FREEDOM. THIS IS A STORY ABOUT FOREVER.
Seventeen-year-old Haven Antonelli has never known freedom. From the time
she was a little girl, she and her mother have been slaves— victims of
human trafficking orchestrated by a vast Mafia network. But when Haven
attempts to escape and is caught, one man gives her a choice: go with him
or die. Agreeing to leave with Dr. Vincent DeMarco, Haven arrives at his
home and meets the doctor’s defiant—yet intriguing—son Carmine. Though
Carmine’s privileged upbringing is a world away from hers, Haven senses the
things they share. And soon her tenuous friendship with Carmine blossoms
into an unexpected love. Carmine has breezed through life breaking every
rule, scorning attachments— until he meets this strange, timid girl his
father has brought home. Her inno­cence draws him in a way he cannot
understand, and makes him feel in ways he never thought he’d experience.
And when he learns the Mafia isn’t through with her, he becomes bent on
protecting her . . . no matter the cost."

6720,6720,"Wall Street Journaland BusinessWeekbestseller Asked to explain why a few
people truly excel, most people offer one of two answers. The first is hard
work. Yet we all know plenty of hard workers who have been doing the same
job for years or decades without becoming great. The other possibility is
that the elite possess an innate talent for excelling in their field. We
assume that Mozart was born with an astounding gift for music, and Warren
Buffett carries a gene for brilliant investing. The trouble is, scientific
evidence doesn't support the notion that specific natural talents make
great performers. According to distinguished journalist Geoff Colvin, both
the hard work and natural talent camps are wrong. What really makes the
difference is a highly specific kind of effort-""deliberate practice""-that
few of us pursue when we're practicing golf or piano or stockpicking. Based
on scientific research, Talent is Overratedshares the secrets of
extraordinary performance and shows how to apply these principles. It
features the stories of people who achieved world-class greatness through
deliberate practice-including Benjamin Franklin, comedian Chris Rock,

centuries' time. The aliens' human collaborators may have been defeated,
but the presence of the sophons, the subatomic particles that allow
Trisolaris instant access to all human information, means that Earth's
defense plans are totally exposed to the enemy. Only the human mind remains
a secret. This is the motivation for the Wallfacer Project, a daring plan
that grants four men enormous resources to design secret strategies, hidden
through deceit and misdirection from Earth and Trisolaris alike. Three of
the Wallfacers are influential statesmen and scientists, but the fourth is
a total unknown. Luo Ji, an unambitious Chinese astronomer and sociologist,
is baffled by his new status. All he knows is that he's the one Wallfacer

6737,6737,"A compelling story of family secrets, love and lossWhen she fell pregnant
as a teenager in Ireland in 1952, Philomena Lee was sent to the convent at
Roscrea in Co. Tipperary to be looked after as a fallen woman. She cared
for her baby for three years until the Church took him from her and sold
him, like countless others, to America for adoption. Coerced into signing a
document promising never to attempt to see her child again, she nonetheless
spent the next fifty years secretly searching for him, unaware that he was
searching for her from across the Atlantic. Philomena's son, renamed
Michael Hess, grew up to be a top Washington lawyer and a leading
Republican official in the Reagan and Bush administrations. But he was a
gay man in a homophobic party where he had to conceal not only his
sexuality but, eventually, the fact that he had AIDs. With little time
left, he returned to Ireland and the convent where he was born: his
desperate quest to find his mother before he died left a legacy that was to
unfold with unexpected consequences for all involved. The Lost Child of
Philomena Lee is the tale of a mother and a son whose lives were scarred by
the forces of hypocrisy on both sides of the Atlantic and of the secrets
they were forced to keep. A compelling narrative of human love and loss,

Manhattan, 1964. Vivian Schuyler, newly graduated from Bryn Mawr College,
has recently defied the privilege of her storied old Fifth Avenue family to
do the unthinkable for a budding Kennedy-era socialite: break into the Mad
Men world of razor-stylish Metropolitan magazine. But when she receives a
bulky overseas parcel in the mail, the unexpected contents draw her
inexorably back into her family's past, and the hushed-over crime
passionnel of an aunt she never knew, whose existence has been wiped from
the record of history. Berlin, 1914. Violet Schuyler Grant endures her
marriage to the philandering and decades-older scientist Dr. Walter Grant
for one reason: for all his faults, he provides the necessary support to
her liminal position as a young American female physicist in prewar
Germany. The arrival of Dr. Grant's magnetic former student at the
beginning of Europe's fateful summer interrupts this delicate detente.
Lionel Richardson, a captain in the British Army, challenges Violet to
escape her husband's perverse hold, and as the world edges into war and
Lionel's shocking true motives become evident, Violet is tempted to take
the ultimate step to set herself free and seek a life of her own conviction
with a man whose cause is as audacious as her own. As the iridescent and
fractured Vivian digs deeper into her aunt's past and the mystery of her
ultimate fate, Violet's story of determination and desire unfolds, shedding
light on the darkness of her years abroad and teaching Vivian to reach
forward with grace for the ambitious future--and the love--she wants

6798,6798,"This book presents a new English translation of two seminal works by Jean-
Paul Sartre, the most dominant European intellectual of the post-World War
II decades. The volume includes Sartre's 1945 lecture “Existentialism Is a
Humanism” and his analysis of Camus's The Stranger, along with a discussion
of these works by acclaimed Sartre biographer Annie Cohen-Solal. This
edition is a translation of the 1996 French edition, which includes Arlette
Elkaïm-Sartre's introduction and a Q&A with Sartre about his lecture. In
her foreword, intended for an American audience, acclaimed Sartre
biographer Annie Cohen-Solal offers an assessment of both works. It was to
correct common misconceptions about his thought that Sartre accepted an
invitation to speak on October 29, 1945, at the Club Maintenant in Paris.
The unstated objective of his lecture (“Existentialism Is a Humanism”) was
to expound his philosophy as a form of “existentialism,” a term much
bandied about at the time. Sartre asserted that existentialism was
essentially a doctrine for philosophers, though, ironically, he was about
to make it accessible to a general audience. The published text of his
lecture quickly became one of the bibles of existentialism and made Sartre
an international celebrity. The idea of freedom occupies the center of
Sartre's doctrine. Man, born into an empty, godless universe, is nothing to
begin with. He creates his essence—his self, his being—through the choices
he freely makes (“existence precedes essence”). Were it not for the
contingency of his death, he would never end. Choosing to be this or that
is to affirm the value of what we choose. In choosing, therefore, we commit
not only ourselves but all of mankind."

Vaelin Al Sorna must help his queen reclaim her Realm. Only his enemy has a
dangerous new collaborator, one with powers darker than Vaelin has ever
encountered. The Ally is there, but only ever as a shadow, unexplained
catastrophe or murder committed at the behest of a dark and vengeful
spirit. Sorting truth from myth is often a fruitless task. After fighting
back from the brink of death, Queen Lyrna is determined to repel the
invading Volarian army and regain the independence of the Unified Realm.
Except, to accomplish her goals, she must do more than rally her loyal
supporters. She must align herself with forces she once found repugnant --
those who possess the strange and varied gifts of the Dark -- and take the
war to her enemy's doorstep. Victory rests on the shoulders of Vaelin Al
Sorna, now named Battle Lord of the Realm. However, his path is riddled
with difficulties. For the Volarians have a new weapon on their side, one
that Vaelin must destroy if the Realm is to prevail: a mysterious Ally with
the ability to grant unnaturally long life to his servants. And defeating
one who cannot be killed is a nearly impossible challenge, especially when
Vaelin's blood-song, the mystical power that has made him the epic fighter
he is, has gone ominously silent."""

MacKayla Lane and Jericho Barrons return in the blockbuster Fever series
from Karen Marie Moning. It's easy to walk away from lies. Power is another
thing. MacKayla Lane would do anything to save the home she loves. A gifted
sidhe-seer, she's already fought and defeated the deadly Sinsar Dubh--an
ancient book of terrible evil--yet its hold on her has never been stronger.
When the wall that protected humans from the seductive, insatiable Fae was
destroyed on Halloween, long-imprisoned immortals ravaged the planet. Now
Dublin is a war zone with factions battling for control. As the city heats
up and the ice left by the Hoar Frost King melts, tempers flare, passions
run red-hot, and dangerous lines get crossed. Seelie and Unseelie vie for
power against nine ancient immortals who have governed Dublin for
millennia; a rival band of sidhe-seers invades the city, determined to
claim it for their own; Mac's former protégé and best friend, Dani ""Mega""
O'Malley, is now her fierce enemy; and even more urgent, Highland druid
Christian MacKeltar has been captured by the Crimson Hag and is being
driven deeper into Unseelie madness with each passing day. The only one Mac
can depend on is the powerful, dangerous immortal Jericho Barrons, but even
their fiery bond is tested by betrayal. It's a world where staying alive is
a constant struggle, the line between good and evil is blurred, and every
alliance comes at a price. In an epic battle against dark forces, Mac must
decide who she can trust, and what her survival is ultimately worth. Praise

year ordeal as a victim of Nazi cruelty. From her comfortable home in
Bielitz (present-day Bielsko) in Poland to her miraculous survival and her
liberation by American troops--including the man who was to become her
husband--in Volary, Czechoslovakia, in 1945, Gerda takes the reader on a
terrifying journey. Gerda's serene and idyllic childhood is shattered when
Nazis march into Poland on September 3, 1939. Although the Weissmanns were
permitted to live for a while in the basement of their home, they were
eventually separated and sent to German labor camps. Over the next few
years Gerda experienced the slow, inexorable stripping away of ""all but her
life."" By the end of the war she had lost her parents, brother, home,
possessions, and community; even the dear friends she made in the labor

settling down. She is attending art school, pursuing her dreams of becoming

not developing as fast as her friends are. But when puberty does hit, it
brings more than hormone surges. Chloe starts seeing ghosts–everywhere,
demanding her attention. After she suffers a breakdown, her devoted aunt
Lauren gets her into a highly recommended group home. At first, Lyle House
seems a pretty okay place, except for Chloe’s small problem of fearing she
might be facing a lifetime of mental illness. But as she gradually gets to
know the other kids at the home–charming Simon and his ominous, unsmiling
brother Derek, obnoxious Tori, and Rae, who has a “thing” for fire–Chloe
begins to realize that there is something that binds them all together, and
it isn’t your usual “problem kid” behaviour. And together they discover
that Lyle House is not your usual group home either… The Awakening The

disgruntled witch – and we have to find someone who can help us gain our
freedom back before The Edison Group finds us first. Or die trying. The

experiment. We're hiding in a safe house that might not be as safe as it
seems. We'll be gone soon anyway, back to rescue those we'd left behind and

Shakespeare's plays. In it, a duke temporarily removes himself from
governing his city-state, deputizing a member of his administration,
Angelo, to enforce the laws more rigorously. Angelo chooses as his first
victim Claudio, condemning him to death because he impregnated Juliet
before their marriage. Claudio's sister Isabella, who is entering a
convent, pleads for her brother's life. Angelo attempts to extort sex from
her, but Isabella preserves her chastity. The duke, in disguise, eavesdrops
as she tells her brother about Angelo's behavior, then offers to ally
himself with her against Angelo. Modern responses to the play show how it
can be transformed by its reception in present culture to evoke continuing
fascination. To some, the duke (the government) seems meddlesome; to
others, he is properly imposing moral standards. Angelo and Isabella's
encounter exemplifies sexual harassment. Others see a woman's right to
control her body in Isabella's choice between her virginity and her
brother's life. The authoritative edition of Measure for Measure from The
Folger Shakespeare Library, the trusted and widely used Shakespeare series
for students and general readers, is now available as an eBook. Features

Jones' new novel is set mainly in a small village on Bougainville, a
country torn apart by civil war. Mathilda attends the school set up by Mr
Watts, the only white man on the island. By his own admission he's not much
of a teacher and proceeds to educate the children by reading them Great
Expectations. Mathilda falls in love with the novel, strongly identifying
with Pip. The promise of the next chapter is what keeps her going; Pip's
story protects her from the horror of what is happening around her -
helicopters menacing the skies above the village and rebel raids on the
ground. When the rebels visit the village searching for any remaining men
to join their cause, they discover the name Pip written in the sand and
instigate a search for him. When Pip can't be found the soldiers destroy
the book. Mr Watts then encourages the children to retell the story from
their memories. Then when the rebels invade the village, the teacher tells
them a story which lasts seven nights, about a boy named Pip, and a
convict...Years later, when she has fled the island for Australia, Matilda
reaches for a copy of Great Expectations in the school library and realises
that Mr Watts was reading them his own version of the text, another
'invention' of the original.Later she pursues Mr Watts's memory to
Wellington, New Zealand, and that of Dickens and Pip to London and
Gravesend. Jones frames Matilda's story with Pip's story and so creates a
Pacific Great Expectations. Mister Pip explores notions of storytelling,
and the role of imagination in inventing the self. Lloyd Jones always

difficult to claim. Tessa’s life begins to come unglued. Nothing is what
she thought it was. Not her friends. Not her family. The one person she
should be able to rely on, Hardin, is furious when he discovers the massive
secret she’s been keeping. And rather than being understanding, he turns to
sabotage. Tessa knows Hardin loves her and will do anything to protect her,
but there’s a difference between loving someone and being able to have them
in your life. This cycle of jealousy, unpredictable anger, and forgiveness
is exhausting. She’s never felt so intensely for anyone, so exhilarated by
someone’s kiss—but is the irrepressible heat between her and Hardin worth
all the drama? Love used to be enough to hold them together. But if Tessa
follows her heart now, will it be...the end?"

form of a dialectical lyric to present his conception of faith. Abraham is
portrayed as a great man, who chose to sacrifice his son, Isaac, in the
face of conflicting expectations and in defiance of any conceivable ethical
standard. The infamous and controversial 'teleological suspension of the
ethical' challenged the contemporary views of Hegel's universal moral
system, and the suffering individual must alone make a choice 'on the

Bradshaw, a caustically charming twenty-something who isn't exactly living

an ancient Toyota, and has a history of choosing men who fall several
thousand feet below acceptable boyfriend standard. Not to mention that she
shares an apartment with a scruffy, tactless roommate, her best girlfriends
are a little too perfect, and the most affectionate male in her life -- her
cat, Fatboy -- occasionally pees in her underwear drawer. Then Helen gets
the telephone call she least expects: Her father has had a massive heart

already chaotic life (they were never very close, after all), Helen is
surprised to find everything else starting to crumble around her. Her pushy
mother is coming apart at the seams, a close friend might be heading toward
tragedy, and, after the tequila incident, it looks as though Tom the vet

as a master of the literary thriller with his international bestsellers The
Club Dumas and The Queen of the South. Now, in this haunting new work,
Pérez-Reverte has written his most accomplished novel to date. The Painter
of Battles is a captivating tale of love, war, art, and revenge. Andrés
Faulques, a world-renowned war photographer, has retired to a life of
solitude on the Spanish coast. On the walls of a tower overlooking the sea,
he spends his days painting a huge mural that pays homage to history’s
classic works of war art and that incorporates a lifetime of disturbing
images. One night, an unexpected visitor arrives at Faulques’ door and
challenges the painter to remember him. As Faulques struggles to recall the
face, the man explains that he was the subject of an iconic photo taken by
Faulques in a war zone years ago. “And why have you come looking for me?”
asks Faulques. The stranger answers, “Because I’m going to kill you.” This
story transports Faulques to the time when he crossed continents to capture
conflicts on film with his lover, Olvido, at his side. Until she walked
into his life, Faulques muses, he had believed he would survive both war
and women. As the tense dialogue between Faulques and his visitor
continues, the stakes grow ever higher. What they are grappling with
quickly proves to be not just Faulques’ fate but the very nature of human
love and cruelty itself. Arturo Pérez-Reverte perfectly balances the
shadows of the heart with the chaos of war in this stunning composition on
morality. Superb and tautly written, The Painter of Battles is a deeply
affecting novel about life and art."

confounded, captivated, angered, and amused but ever entertained - readers
worldwide. While on the surface a comic, disjointed account of the title
character's life and times, the work is in fact a brilliant commentary on
life's inherent chaos, the pointed challenge of British clergy-man-turned-
author Laurence Sterne to the twin concepts of rationalism and
sentimentalism. Delineating his views through skillfully drawn
representations - among them Tristram, Yorick, and Uncle Toby - Sterne
pinpointed issues central to not only his era but our own. Filled with

P.D. James Spring, 1543. King Henry VIII is wooing Lady Catherine Parr,
whom he wants for his sixth wife. But this time the object of his
affections is resisting. Archbishop Cranmer and the embattled Protestant
faction at court are watching keenly, for Lady Catherine is known to have
reformist sympathies. Matthew Shardlake, meanwhile, is working on the case

insane. Should he be released to his parents, when his terrifying actions
could lead to him being burned as a heretic? When an old friend is
horrifically murdered Shardlake promises his widow, for whom he has long
had complicated feelings, to bring the killer to justice. His search leads
him to both Cranmer and Catherine Parr - and with the dark prophecies of
the Book of Revelation. As London's Bishop Bonner prepares a purge of
Protestants Shardlake, together with his assistant, Jack Barak, and his
friend, Guy Malton, follow the trail of a series of horrific murders that
shake them to the core, and which are already bringing frenzied talk of
witchcraft and a demonic possession - for what else would the Tudor mind

desk she inherited from a young poet who disappeared at the hands of
Pinochet's secret police; one day a girl claiming to be the poet's daughter
arrives to take it away, sending the writer's life reeling. Across the
ocean, in the leafy suburbs of London, a man caring for his dying wife
discovers, among her papers, a lock of hair that unravels a terrible
secret. In Jerusalem, an antiques dealer slowly reassembles his father's
study, plundered by the Nazis from Budapest in 1944. Connecting these
stories is a desk of many drawers that exerts a power over those who
possess it or give it away. As the narrators of Great House make their
confessions, the desk takes on more and more meaning, and comes finally to
stand for all that has been taken from them, and all that binds them to
what has disappeared. Great House is a story haunted by questions: What do
we pass on to our children, and how do they absorb our dreams and losses?
How do we respond to disappearance, destruction, and change? Nicole Krauss
has written a soaring, powerful novel about memory struggling to create a
meaningful permanence in the face of inevitable loss. 'In surges of
mesmerizing sentences that are so complicated, clever, artful, and
logically challenging that they read almost like aphorisms, Krauss aims to
explicate, not the underlying implications of her characters' behaviour,
but the very cycles of history. It's a daunting undertaking, one that not
every writer under forty would choose or can do justice to, but Krauss's
talent runs deep. And she cannot write a bad sentence: pound for pound, the
sentences alone deliver epiphany upon epiphany.' Huffington Post
'Remarkable...... Krauss builds a consuming rush of a novel, far more
organic and eloquent than her much-lauded The History of Love.' Bookforum

7117,7117,"Now nearing its sixtieth printing in English and translated into nineteen
languages, Michael E. Porter's Competitive Strategy has transformed the
theory, practice, and teaching of business strategy throughout the world.
Electrifying in its simplicity—like all great breakthroughs—Porter’s
analysis of industries captures the complexity of industry competition in
five underlying forces. Porter introduces one of the most powerful
competitive tools yet developed: his three generic strategies—lowest cost,
differentiation, and focus—which bring structure to the task of strategic
positioning. He shows how competitive advantage can be defined in terms of
relative cost and relative prices, thus linking it directly to
profitability, and presents a whole new perspective on how profit is
created and divided. In the almost two decades since publication, Porter's
framework for predicting competitor behavior has transformed the way in
which companies look at their rivals and has given rise to the new
discipline of competitor assessment. More than a million managers in both
large and small companies, investment analysts, consultants, students, and
scholars throughout the world have internalized Porter's ideas and applied
them to assess industries, understand competitors, and choose competitive
positions. The ideas in the book address the underlying fundamentals of
competition in a way that is independent of the specifics of the ways
companies go about competing. Competitive Strategy has filled a void in
management thinking. It provides an enduring foundation and grounding point
on which all subsequent work can be built. By bringing a disciplined
structure to the question of how firms achieve superior profitability,
Porter’s rich frameworks and deep insights comprise a sophisticated view of
competition unsurpassed in the last quarter-century."

Among Others is at once the compelling story of a young woman struggling to
escape a troubled childhood, a brilliant diary of first encounters with the
great novels of modern fantasy and SF, and a spellbinding tale of escape
from ancient enchantment. Raised by a half-mad mother who dabbled in magic,
Morwenna Phelps found refuge in two worlds. As a child growing up in Wales,
she played among the spirits who made their homes in industrial ruins. But
her mind found freedom and promise in the science fiction novels that were
her closest companions. Then her mother tried to bend the spirits to dark
ends, and Mori was forced to confront her in a magical battle that left her
crippled--and her twin sister dead. Fleeing to her father whom she barely
knew, Mori was sent to boarding school in England-a place all but devoid of
true magic. There, outcast and alone, she tempted fate by doing magic
herself, in an attempt to find a circle of like-minded friends. But her
magic also drew the attention of her mother, bringing about a reckoning
that could no longer be put off... Combining elements of autobiography with
flights of imagination in the manner of novels like Jonathan Lethem's The

MCMASTER BUJOLD HER FIRST HUGO AWARD. Sequel to The Warrior's Apprentice.
THE PRINCE AND THE MERCENARY Miles Vorkosigan has shaken the High Command
of his home planet Barrayar to the core and has been sent to the other side
of the galaxy as a result. There Miles runs into his old pals, the Free
Dendarii Mercenaries. And a good thing, too, because it turns out that
Miles's childhood chum--Emperor Gregor to you and me--has been the victim
of foul play, and only Miles can save him. In fact, Miles knows he must
save Gregor. Because if he doesn't, then the only person who could become
emperor is Miles himself, which is, for Miles, a fate worse than death!

thoughts and achieve compassion? The speech captures Wallace's electric

became a treasured piece of writing reprinted in The Wall Street Journal
and the London Times, commented on endlessly in blogs, and emailed from

7183,7183,"The great philosopher's major work on ethics, along with Ecce Homo,
Nietzche's remarkable review of his life and works. On the Genealogy of
Morals (1887) shows him using philsophy, psychology, and classical
philology in an effort to give new direction to an ancient discipline. The
work consists of three essays. The first contrasts master morality and
slave morality and indicates how the term ""good"" has widely different
meanings in each. The second inquiry deals with guilt and the bad
conscience; the third with ascetic ideals—not only in religion but also in
the academy. Ecce Homo, written in 1898 and first published posthumously in
1908, is Nietzsche's review of his life and works. It contains chapters on
all the books he himself published. His interpretations are as fascinating
as they are invaluable. Nothing Nietzsche wrote is more stunning
stylistically or as a human document. Walter Kaufmann's masterful
translations are faithful of the word and spirit of Nietzsche, and his
running footnote commentaries on both books are more comprehensive than
those in his other Nietzsche translations because these tow works have been
so widely misunderstood."

7252,7252,"If I tell you right up front, right in the beginning that I lost him, it
will be easier for you to bear. You will know it's coming, and it will
hurt. But you'll be able to prepare. Someone found him in a laundry basket
at the Quick Wash, wrapped in a towel, a few hours old and close to death.
They called him Baby Moses when they shared his story on the ten o'clock
news - the little baby left in a basket at a dingy Laundromat, born to a
crack addict and expected to have all sorts of problems. I imagined the
crack baby, Moses, having a giant crack that ran down his body, like he'd
been broken at birth. I knew that wasn't what the term meant, but the image
stuck in my mind. Maybe the fact that he was broken drew me to him from the
start. It all happened before I was born, and by the time I met Moses and
my mom told me all about him, the story was old news and nobody wanted
anything to do with him. People love babies, even sick babies. Even crack
babies. But babies grow up to be kids, and kids grow up to be teenagers.
Nobody wants a messed up teenager.And Moses was messed up. Moses was a law
unto himself. But he was also strange and exotic and beautiful. To be with
him would change my life in ways I could never have imagined. Maybe I
should have stayed away. Maybe I should have listened. My mother warned me.
Even Moses warned me. But I didn't stay away. And so begins a story of pain
and promise, of heartache and healing, of life and death. A story of before
and after, of new beginnings and never-endings. But most of all . . . a
love story."

It is a mantra, a duty, a way of life in a tightly monitored world where
thinking is dangerous and books are forbidden. In 1953, Ray Bradbury
envisioned one of the world's most unforgettable dystopian futures, and in
Ray Bradbury's Fahrenheit 451, the artist Tim Hamilton translates this
frightening modern masterpiece into a gorgeously imagined graphic novel. As
could only occur with Bradbury's full cooperation in this authorized
adaptation, Hamilton has created a striking work of art that uniquely
captures Montag's awakening to the evil of government-controlled thought

Including an original foreword by Ray Bradbury and fully depicting the
brilliance and force of his canonic and beloved masterwork, Ray Bradbury's

Glenn Beck delivers an instant holiday classic about boyhood memories,

Regrets, Sorrows and Mistakes...Would You? We weren't wealthy, we weren't
poor -- we just were. We never wanted for anything, except maybe more time
together.... When Eddie was twelve years old, all he wanted for Christmas
was a bike. Although his life had gotten harder -- and money tighter --
since his father died and the family bakery closed...Eddie dreamed that
somehow his mother would find a way to have his dream bike gleaming beside
their modest Christmas tree that magical morning. What he got from her
instead was a sweater. ""A stupid, handmade, ugly sweater"" that young Eddie
left in a crumpled ball in the corner of his room. Scarred deeply by the
realization that kids don't always get what they want, and too young to
understand that he already owned life's most valuable treasures, that
Christmas morning was the beginning of Eddie's dark and painful journey on
the road to manhood. It will take wrestling with himself, his faith, and
his family -- and the guidance of a mysterious neighbor named Russell -- to
help Eddie find his path through the storm clouds of life and finally see
the real significance of that simple gift his mother had crafted by hand
with love in her heart. Based on a deeply personal true story, The
Christmas Sweater is a warm and poignant tale of family, faith and
forgiveness that offers us a glimpse of our own lives -- while also making
us question if we really know what's most important in them."

era France. In this first of three books inspired by the life of Josephine
Bonaparte, Sandra Gulland has created a novel of immense and magical
proportions. We meet Josephine in the exotic and lush Martinico, where an
old island woman predicts that one day she will be queen. The journey from
the remote village of her birth to the height of European elegance is long,
but Josephine's fortune proves to be true. By way of fictionalized diary
entries, we traverse her early years as she marries her one true love,
bears his children, and is left betrayed, widowed, and penniless. It is
Josephine's extraordinary charm, cunning, and will to survive that
catapults her to the heart of society, where she meets Napoleon, whose
destiny will prove to be irrevocably intertwined with hers."

7437,7437,"Neuroscientist V.S. Ramachandran is internationally renowned for uncovering
answers to the deep and quirky questions of human nature that few
scientists have dared to address. His bold insights about the brain are
matched only by the stunning simplicity of his experiments -- using such
low-tech tools as cotton swabs, glasses of water and dime-store mirrors. In
Phantoms in the Brain, Dr. Ramachandran recounts how his work with patients
who have bizarre neurological disorders has shed new light on the deep
architecture of the brain, and what these findings tell us about who we
are, how we construct our body image, why we laugh or become depressed, why
we may believe in God, how we make decisions, deceive ourselves and dream,
perhaps even why we're so clever at philosophy, music and art. Some of his
most notable cases: A woman paralyzed on the left side of her body who
believes she is lifting a tray of drinks with both hands offers a unique
opportunity to test Freud's theory of denial. A man who insists he is
talking with God challenges us to ask: Could we be ""wired"" for religious
experience? A woman who hallucinates cartoon characters illustrates how, in
a sense, we are all hallucinating, all the time. Dr. Ramachandran's
inspired medical detective work pushes the boundaries of medicine's last
great frontier -- the human mind -- yielding new and provocative insights
into the ""big questions"" about consciousness and the self."

smiling. Samantha McAllister looks just like the rest of the popular girls
in her junior class. But hidden beneath the straightened hair and expertly
applied makeup is a secret that her friends would never understand: Sam has
Purely-Obsessional OCD and is consumed by a stream of dark thoughts and
worries that she can't turn off. Second-guessing every move, thought, and
word makes daily life a struggle, and it doesn't help that her lifelong
friends will turn toxic at the first sign of a wrong outfit, wrong lunch,
or wrong crush. Yet Sam knows she'd be truly crazy to leave the protection
of the most popular girls in school. So when Sam meets Caroline, she has to
keep her new friend with a refreshing sense of humor and no style a secret,
right up there with Sam's weekly visits to her psychiatrist. Caroline
introduces Sam to Poet's Corner, a hidden room and a tight-knit group of
misfits who have been ignored by the school at large. Sam is drawn to them
immediately, especially a guitar-playing guy with a talent for verse, and
starts to discover a whole new side of herself. Slowly, she begins to feel
more ""normal"" than she ever has as part of the popular crowd . . . until
she finds a new reason to question her sanity and all she holds dear.

Catholic in Freehold, New Jersey, amid the poetry, danger, and darkness
that fueled his imagination, leading up to the moment he refers to as The
Big Bang: seeing Elvis Presley s debut on The Ed Sullivan Show. He vividly
recounts his relentless drive to become a musician, his early days as a bar
band king in Asbury Park, and the rise of the E Street Band. With disarming
candor, he also tells for the first time the story of the personal
struggles that inspired his best work. Born to Run will be revelatory for

than a legendary rock star s memoir. This is a book for workers and
dreamers, parents and children, lovers and loners, artists, freaks, or
anyone who has ever wanted to be baptized in the holy river of rock and
roll. Rarely has a performer told his own story with such force and sweep.
Like many of his songs (""Thunder Road, ""Badlands."" ""Darkness on the edge of

September. Often people's lives reflect the weather and The Hurricane
Sisters is just such a story. Once again New York Times bestselling author
Dorothea Benton Frank takes us deep into the heart of her magical South
Carolina Lowcountry on a tumultuous journey filled with longings,
disappointments, and, finally, a road toward happiness that is hard earned.
There we meet three generations of women buried in secrets. The determined
matriarch, Maisie Pringle, at eighty, is a force to be reckoned with
because she will have the final word on everything, especially when she's
dead wrong. Her daughter, Liz, is caught up in the classic maelstrom of
being middle-age and in an emotionally demanding career that will
eventually open all their eyes to a terrible truth. And Liz's beautiful
twenty-something daughter, Ashley, whose dreamy ambitions of her unlikely
future keeps them all at odds. Luckily for Ashley, her wonderful older
brother, Ivy, is her fierce champion but he can only do so much from San
Francisco where he resides with his partner. And Mary Beth, her dearest
friend, tries to have her back but even she can't talk headstrong Ashley
out of a relationship with an ambitious politician who seems slightly too
old for her. Actually, Ashley and Mary Beth have yet to launch themselves
into solvency. Their prospects seem bleak. So while they wait for the world
to discover them and deliver them from a ramen-based existence, they
placate themselves with a hare-brained scheme to make money but one that
threatens to land them in huge trouble with the authorities. So where is
Clayton, Liz's husband? He seems more distracted than usual. Ashley
desperately needs her father's love and attention but what kind of a parent
can he be to Ashley with one foot in Manhattan and the other one planted in
indiscretion? And Liz, who's an expert in the field of troubled domestic
life, refuses to acknowledge Ashley's precarious situation. Who's in charge
of this family? The wake-up call is about to arrive. The Lowcountry has
endured its share of war and bloodshed like the rest of the South, but this
storm season we watch Maisie, Liz, Ashley, and Mary Beth deal with
challenges that demand they face the truth about themselves. After a
terrible confrontation they are forced to rise to forgiveness, but can they
establish a new order for the future of them all? Frank, with her hallmark
scintillating wit and crisp insight, captures how a complex family of
disparate characters and their close friends can overcome anything through
the power of love and reconciliation. This is the often hilarious,
sometimes sobering, but always entertaining story of how these
unforgettable women became The Hurricane Sisters."
7536,7536,"A distinguished psychiatrist from Martinique who took part in the Algerian
Nationalist Movement, Frantz Fanon was one of the most important theorists
of revolutionary struggle, colonialism, and racial difference in history.
Fanon's masterwork is a classic alongside Edward Said's Orientalism or The
Autobiography of Malcolm X, and it is now available in a new translation
that updates its language for a new generation of readers. The Wretched of
the Earth is a brilliant analysis of the psychology of the colonized and
their path to liberation. Bearing singular insight into the rage and
frustration of colonized peoples, and the role of violence in effecting
historical change, the book incisively attacks the twin perils of post
independence colonial politics: the disenfranchisement of the masses by the
elites on the one hand, and intertribal and interfaith animosities on the
other. Fanon's analysis, a veritable handbook of social reorganization for
leaders of emerging nations, has been reflected all too clearly in the
corruption and violence that has plagued present-day Africa. The Wretched
of the Earth has had a major impact on civil rights, anticolonialism, and
black consciousness movements around the world, and this bold new
translation by Richard Philcox reaffirms it as a landmark."

7554,7554,"A New York Times Bestseller From the author of the New York Times
bestseller All the Bright Places comes a heart-wrenching story about what
it means to see someone—and love someone—for who they truly are. Everyone
thinks they know Libby Strout, the girl once dubbed “America’s Fattest
Teen.” But no one’s taken the time to look past her weight to get to know
who she really is. Following her mom’s death, she’s been picking up the
pieces in the privacy of her home, dealing with her heartbroken father and
her own grief. Now, Libby’s ready: for high school, for new friends, for
love, and for EVERY POSSIBILITY LIFE HAS TO OFFER. In that moment, I know
the part I want to play here at MVB High. I want to be the girl who can do
anything. Everyone thinks they know Jack Masselin, too. Yes, he’s got
swagger, but he’s also mastered the impossible art of giving people what
they want, of fitting in. What no one knows is that Jack has a newly
acquired secret: he can’t recognize faces. Even his own brothers are
strangers to him. He’s the guy who can re-engineer and rebuild anything in
new and bad-ass ways, but he can’t understand what’s going on with the
inner workings of his brain. So he tells himself to play it cool: Be
charming. Be hilarious. Don’t get too close to anyone. Until he meets
Libby. When the two get tangled up in a cruel high school game—which lands
them in group counseling and community service—Libby and Jack are both
pissed, and then surprised. Because the more time they spend together, the
less alone they feel. . . . Because sometimes when you meet someone, it
changes the world, theirs and yours. Jennifer Niven delivers another
poignant, exhilarating love story about finding that person who sees you
for who you are—and seeing them right back. ""Niven is adept at creating
characters. . . . [Libby's] courage and body-positivity make for a joyful

themselves a Nobel Prize. At the time, Watson was only twenty-four, a young
scientist hungry to make his mark. His uncompromisingly honest account of
the heady days of their thrilling sprint against other world-class
researchers to solve one of science’s greatest mysteries gives a dazzlingly
clear picture of a world of brilliant scientists with great gifts, very
human ambitions, and bitter rivalries. With humility unspoiled by false
modesty, Watson relates his and Crick’s desperate efforts to beat Linus
Pauling to the Holy Grail of life sciences, the identification of the basic
building block of life. Never has a scientist been so truthful in capturing
in words the flavor of his work."

states led by warring petty kings. King Almalik of Cartada is on the
ascendancy, aided always by his friend and advisor, the notorious Ammar ibn

brutality changes their relationship forever. Meanwhile, in the north, the
conquered Jaddites' most celebrated -- and feared -- military leader,

the dangerous lands of Al-Rassan, these two men from different worlds meet

court physician, whose own skills play an increasing role as Al-Rassan is

of her birthright as a strong, enlightened twenty-first-century woman. But
there was a price. She often blacked out, waking up with a blank space
where four hours should be. Mornings became detective work on her own life.
What did I say last night? How did I meet that guy? She apologized for
things she couldn't remember doing, as though she were cleaning up after an
evil twin. Publicly, she covered her shame with self-deprecating jokes, and
her career flourished, but as the blackouts accumulated, she could no
longer avoid a sinking truth. The fuel she thought she needed was draining
her spirit instead. A memoir of unblinking honesty and poignant, laugh-out-

adventure--the sober life she never wanted. Shining a light into her
blackouts, she discovers the person she buried, as well as the confidence,
intimacy, and creativity she once believed came only from a bottle. Her
tale will resonate with anyone who has been forced to reinvent or struggled

to know what to do now. Her own identity has been so wrapped up in being
the caretaker, navigator, penny counter, and decision maker that she’s not
sure how to let go of some responsibilities while still keeping a sense of
herself. But when the past comes back with devastating force, Dicey sees
just how necessary—and painful—letting go can be."

Thinking I was a girl, with a name like Misha, the other teacher paired me
up with her student, Ryen. My teacher, believing Ryen was a boy like me,

7682,7682,"Brilliant…stunning,” raved the Los Angeles Times about Conn Iggulden’s
first novel, Emperor: The Gates of Rome. “Iggulden is a grand storyteller,”
declared USA Today. Now Iggulden returns to the landscape of ancient Rome
and the life of Julius Caesar in a new novel filled with all the sumptuous
storytelling that distinguished his first book. Sweeping from the
windswept, pirate-ruled seas to the stifling heat of the Roman senate,
Iggulden takes us further down the path to glory as Julius Caesar comes
into his own as a man, warrior, senator, husband, leader. In a sweltering,
sparsely settled region of North Africa, a band of disheveled soldiers turn
their eyes toward one man among them. Ragged, dirty, and half starved, the
men will follow their leader into the mad, glorious fight for honor and
revenge that only he wants to fight. Their leader is named Julius Caesar.
The soldiers are Roman legionaries. And their quarry is a band of pirates
who made the mistake of seizing Julius Caesar—and holding him for ransom.
Now, to get his revenge, Caesar will turn peasants into soldiers, building
a shipborne fighting force that will not only decimate a pirate fleet but
will dominate the Mediterranean, earning him the coveted title Military
Tribune of Rome. While Caesar builds a legend far from Rome, his friend
Gaius Brutus is fighting battles of another sort, rising to power in the
wake of the shocking assassination of a dictator. Once Brutus and Caesar
were as close as brothers, both devoted to the same ideals and attracted to
the same forbidden woman. Now, when Caesar returns—with the winds of glory
at his back—they will find themselves at odds. For each has built an army
of elite warriors—Caesar’s forged in far-flung battles, Brutus’ from Rome’s
political killing fields. But in an era when men die for their treachery
and their allegiances, the two men will soon be united by a shock wave from
the north. There, a gladiator named Spartacus is gathering strength,
building an army of seventy thousand desperate slaves—to fight a
cataclysmic battle against Rome itself. Filled with unforgettable
images—from the death throes of a king to the birth of Caesar’s child, from
the bloody battlefields of Greece to the silent passion of lovers—Emperor:
The Death of Kings is an astounding work, a stunning blend of vibrant
history and thrilling fiction. From the Hardcover edition."

to you. Then, one snowy night in Manhattan, the prince meets a dark haired
beauty who doesn’t bow down. Instead, she throws a pie in his face.
Nicholas wants to find out if she tastes as good as her pie, and this heir
apparent is used to getting what he wants. Dating a prince isn’t what
waitress Olivia Hammond ever imagined it would be. There’s a disapproving
queen, a wildly inappropriate spare heir, relentless paparazzi, and brutal
public scrutiny. While they’ve traded in horse drawn carriages for Rolls
Royces and haven’t chopped anyone’s head off lately—the royals are far from
accepting of this commoner. But to Olivia—Nicholas is worth it. Nicholas
grew up with the whole world watching, and now Marriage Watch is in full
force. In the end, Nicholas has to decide who he is and, more importantly,
who he wants to be: a King... or the man who gets to love Olivia forever."

7710,7710,"Haruki Murakami is an international phenomenon. When Books One and Two of
his latest masterpiece, 1Q84, were published in Japan, a million copies
were sold in one month, and the critical acclaim that ensued was reported
all over the globe. Readers were transfixed by the mesmerising story of
Aomame and Tengo and the strange parallel universe they inhabit. Then, one
year later, to the surprise and delight of his readers, Murakami published
an unexpected Book Three, bringing the story to a close. In order to
reflect the experience of 1Q84's first readers, Harvill Secker is
publishing Books One and Two in one beautifully designed volume and Book
Three in a separate edition. A long-awaited treat for his fans, 1Q84 is
also a thrilling introduction to the unique world of Murakami's
imagination. This hypnotically addictive novel is a work of startling
originality and, as the title suggests, a mind-bending ode to George
Orwell's Nineteen Eighty-Four. (The number 9 in Japanese is pronounced like
the letter 'Q'). The year is 1984. Aomame sits in a taxi on the expressway
in Tokyo. Her work is not the kind which can be discussed in public but she
is in a hurry to carry out an assignment and, with the traffic at a stand-
still, the driver proposes a solution. She agrees, but as a result of her
actions starts to feel increasingly detached from the real world. She has
been on a top-secret mission, and her next job will lead her to encounter
the apparently superhuman founder of a religious cult. Meanwhile, Tengo is
leading a nondescript life but wishes to become a writer. He inadvertently
becomes involved in a strange affair surrounding a literary prize to which
a mysterious seventeen-year-old girl has submitted her remarkable first
novel. It seems to be based on her own experiences and moves readers in
unusual ways. Can her story really be true? Both Aomame and Tengo notice
that the world has grown strange; both realise that they are indispensable
to each other. While their stories influence one another, at times by
accident and at times intentionally, the two come closer and closer to
intertwining. ** Murakamiâe(tm)s new novel is coming ** COLORLESS TSUKURU

masterpiece"" when it first appeared in 1984, On Food and Cooking is the
bible to which food lovers and professional chefs worldwide turn for an
understanding of where our foods come from, what exactly they're made of,
and how cooking transforms them into something new and delicious. For its
twentieth anniversary, Harold McGee prepared a new, fully revised and
updated edition of On Food and Cooking. He has rewritten the text almost
completely, expanded it by two-thirds, and commissioned more than 100 new
illustrations. As compulsively readable and engaging as ever, the new On
Food and Cooking provides countless eye-opening insights into food, its
preparation, and its enjoyment. On Food and Cooking pioneered the
translation of technical food science into cook-friendly kitchen science
and helped birth the inventive culinary movement known as ""molecular
gastronomy."" Though other books have been written about kitchen science, On
Food and Cooking remains unmatched in the accuracy, clarity, and
thoroughness of its explanations, and the intriguing way in which it blends
science with the historical evolution of foods and cooking techniques.
Among the major themes addressed throughout the new edition are: ·
Traditional and modern methods of food production and their influences on
food quality · The great diversity of methods by which people in different
places and times have prepared the same ingredients · Tips for selecting
the best ingredients and preparing them successfully · The particular
substances that give foods their flavors, and that give us pleasure · Our
evolving knowledge of the health benefits and risks of foods On Food and

7804,7804,"The lady, an investigator who excels at uncovering information to save her
clients from execution . . . The fallen priest, beaten down by his guilt
over a terrible sin and its tragic consequences . . . The warden, a kind
man within a cruel system . . . The mute prisoner, sensing what others
cannot in what he calls ""this enchanted place"" . . . The enchanted place is
an ancient stone prison. Two outsiders walk here: a woman known only as the
lady, and a fallen priest. The lady comes to the prison when she has a job
to do. She's skilled at finding the secrets that get men off death row.
This gift threatens her career—and complicates her life—when she takes on
the case of York, a killer whose date of execution looms. York is different
from the lady's former clients: he wants to die. Going against the
condemned man's wishes, the lady begins her work. What she uncovers about
York's birth and upbringing rings chillingly familiar. In York's shocking
and shameful childhood, the lady sees the shadows of her own. The lady is
watched by a death row inmate who finds escape in the books he reads from
the prison library and by reimagining the world he inhabits—a world of
majestic golden horses that stampede underground and of tiny men who hammer
away inside stone walls. He is not named, nor do we know his crime. But he
listens. He listens to York's story. He sees the lady fall in love with the
priest and wonders how such warmth is possible in these crumbling
corridors. As tensions in ""this enchanted place"" build, he sees the
corruption and the danger. And he waits as the hour of his own destiny
approaches. The Enchanted is a magical novel about redemption, the poetry
that can exist within the unfathomable, and the human capacity to transcend
and survive even the most nightmarish reality. Beautiful and unexpected,
this is a memorable story."

7919,7919,"Bestselling author Jodi Picoult is a masterful storyteller, who “writes
with a fine touch, a sharp eye for detail, and a firm grasp of the delicacy
and complexity of human relationships” (The Boston Globe). Now, in this
original short story, available exclusively as an eBook, Picoult introduces
Serenity Jones, one of the fascinating characters from her eagerly awaited
new novel, Leaving Time. Even as a child, Serenity Jones knew she possessed
unusual psychic gifts. Now, decades later, she’s an acclaimed medium and
host of her own widely viewed TV show, where she delivers messages to the
living from loved ones who have passed. Lately, though, her efforts to
boost ratings and garner fame have compromised her clairvoyant instincts.
When Serenity books a young war widow to appear as a guest, the episode
quickly unravels, stirring up a troubling controversy. And as she tries to
undo the damage—to both her reputation and her show—Serenity finds that
pride comes at a high price. Praise for Jodi Picoult “Picoult is a rare
writer who delivers, book after book, a winning combination of the literary
and the commercial.”—Entertainment Weekly “Picoult is a solid, lively
storyteller.”—The New York Times “If Picoult were a general, she would be
Patton; if a sports franchise, the New York Yankees; if a natural

7927,7927,"From the award-winning champion of culinary simplicity who gave us the
bestselling How to Cook Everything and How to Cook Everything Vegetarian
comes Food Matters, a plan for responsible eating that's as good for the
planet as it is for your weight and your health. We are finally starting to
acknowledge the threat carbon emissions pose to our ozone layer, but few
people have focused on the extent to which our consumption of meat
contributes to global warming. Think about it this way: In terms of energy
consumption, serving a typical family-of-four steak dinner is the rough
equivalent of driving around in an SUV for three hours while leaving all
the lights on at home. Bittman offers a no-nonsense rundown on how
government policy, big business marketing, and global economics influence
what we choose to put on the table each evening. He demystifies buzzwords
like “organic,” “sustainable,” and “local” and offers straightforward,
budget-conscious advice that will help you make small changes that will
shrink your carbon footprint—and your waistline. Flexible, simple, and non-
doctrinaire, the plan is based on hard science but gives you plenty of
leeway to tailor your food choices to your lifestyle, schedule, and level
of commitment. Bittman, a food writer who loves to eat and eats out
frequently, lost thirty-five pounds and saw marked improvement in his blood
levels by simply cutting meat and processed foods out of two of his three
daily meals. But the simple truth, as he points out, is that as long as you
eat more vegetables and whole grains, the result will be better health for
you and for the world in which we live. Unlike most things that are
virtuous and healthful, Bittman's plan doesn't involve sacrifice. From
Spinach and Sweet Potato Salad with Warm Bacon Dressing to Breakfast Bread
Pudding, the recipes in Food Matters are flavorful and sophisticated. A
month's worth of meal plans shows you how Bittman chooses to eat and offers
proof of how satisfying a mindful and responsible diet can be. Cheaper,
healthier, and socially sound, Food Matters represents the future of
American eating."

7950,7950,"New York Times bestselling author and “oneofAmerica’stop cultural critics”
(Entertainment Weekly) Chuck Klosterman’s debut novel brilliantly captures
the charm and dread of small town life—now available in trade paperback.
Somewhere in rural North Dakota, there is a fictional town called Owl. They
don’t have cable. They don’t really have pop culture, but they do have
grain prices and alcoholism. People work hard and then they die. But that’s
not nearly as awful as it sounds; in fact, sometimes it’s perfect. Mitch
Hrlicka lives in Owl. He plays high school football and worries about his
weirdness, or lack thereof. Julia Rabia just moved to Owl. A history
teacher, she gets free booze and falls in love with a self-loathing bison
farmer. Widower and local conversationalist Horace Jones has resided in Owl
for seventy-three years. They all know each other completely, except that
they’ve never met. But when a deadly blizzard— based on an actual storm
that occurred in 1984—hits the area, their lives are derailed in unex-
pected and powerful ways. An unpretentious, darkly comedic story of how it
feels to exist in a community where local mythology and violent reality are
pretty much the same thing, Downtown Owl is “a satisfying character study
and strikes a perfect balance between the funny and the pro- found”

7960,7960,"A remarkable history with elements of both In the President’s Secret
Service and The Butler, The Residence offers an intimate account of the
service staff of the White House, from the Kennedys to the Obamas.
America’s First Families are unknowable in many ways. No one has insight
into their true character like the people who serve their meals and make
their beds every day. Full of stories and details by turns dramatic,
humorous, and heartwarming, The Residence reveals daily life in the White
House as it is really lived through the voices of the maids, butlers,
cooks, florists, doormen, engineers, and others who tend to the needs of
the President and First Family. These dedicated professionals maintain the
six-floor mansion’s 132 rooms, 35 bathrooms, 28 fireplaces, three
elevators, and eight staircases, and prepare everything from hors d’oeuvres
for intimate gatherings to meals served at elaborate state dinners. Over
the course of the day, they gather in the lower level’s basement kitchen to
share stories, trade secrets, forge lifelong friendships, and sometimes
even fall in love. Combining incredible first-person anecdotes from
extensive interviews with scores of White House staff members—many speaking
for the first time—with archival research, Kate Andersen Brower tells their
story. She reveals the intimacy between the First Family and the people who
serve them, as well as tension that has shaken the staff over the decades.
From the housekeeper and engineer who fell in love while serving President
Reagan to Jackie Kennedy’s private moment of grief with a beloved staffer
after her husband’s assassination to the tumultuous days surrounding
President Nixon’s resignation and President Clinton’s impeachment battle,
The Residence is full of surprising and moving details that illuminate day-

clueless comes I Will Teach You To Be Rich, Ramit Sethi's 6-week personal
finance program for 20-to-35-year-olds. A completely practical approach
delivered with a nonjudgmental style that makes readers want to do what
Sethi says, it is based around the four pillars of personal finance--
banking, saving, budgeting, and investing--and the wealth-building ideas of
personal entrepreneurship. Sethi covers how to save time by not wasting it
managing money; the guns and cars myth of credit cards; how to negotiate
like an Indian--the conversation begins with ""no""; why ""Budgeting Doesn't
Have to Suck!""; how to get things rolling--for real--with only $20; what
most people don't understand about taxes; how to get a CEO to take you out
to lunch; how to avoid the Super Mario Brothers trap by making your savings
work harder than you do; the difference between cheap and frugal; the
hidden relationship between money and food. Not to mention his first key
lesson: Getting started is more important than being the smartest person in
the room. Integrated with his website, where readers can use interactive
charts, follow up on the latest information, and join the community, it is
a hip blueprint to building wealth and financial security. Every month,
175,000 unique visitors come to Ramit Sethi's website,

praise him thoughtfully (""Your site summarizes everything I want with my
life--to be rich in finances, rich in experience, rich in family
blessings,"" Dan Esparza) and effusively (""Dude, you rock. I love this
site!"" Richard Wu). The press has caught on, too: ""Ramit Sethi is a rising
star in the world of personal finance writing . . . one singularly attuned
to the sensibilities of his generation. his style is part frat boy and part
silicon Valley geek, with a little bit of San Francisco hipster thrown in""

stretching out the performance, especially when a sister reveals she's HIV

and physical hardship upon the city's working-class community. Paralleling
the novel's treatment of the relationship between masters and men, the
suffering of the poor, and the workmen's angry response, is the story of
Mary herself--a factory-worker's daughter who attracts the attentions of
the mill-owner's son, who becomes caught up in the violence of class
conflict when a brutal murder forces her to confront her true feelings and
allegiances. This new edition reproduces the last edition of the novel
supervised by Gaskell. The introduction provides historical and

Barton, and argues that Gaskell was chiefly concerned with the importance
of communication as a means of healing breaches between people. In
addition, the book contains an up-to-date critical biography, revised notes
and appendixes that include Gaskell's rough draft and outline of the
novel's conclusion. About the Series: For over 100 years Oxford World's

memoir, a work of ""autotheory"" offering fresh, fierce, and timely thinking
about desire, identity, and the limitations and possibilities of love and
language. At its center is a romance: the story of the author's

Nelson's account of falling in love with Dodge, who is fluidly gendered, as
well as her journey to and through a pregnancy, offers a firsthand account
of the complexities and joys of (queer) family-making. Writing in the
spirit of public intellectuals such as Susan Sontag and Roland Barthes,
Nelson binds her personal experience to a rigorous exploration of what
iconic theorists have said about sexuality, gender, and the vexed
institutions of marriage and child-rearing. Nelson's insistence on radical
individual freedom and the value of caretaking becomes the rallying cry of
this thoughtful, unabashed, uncompromising book."

Anderson Cooper’s intensely busy career as a journalist for CNN and CBS’ 60
Minutes affords him little time to spend with his ninety-one year old
mother. After she briefly fell ill, he and Gloria began a conversation
through e-mail unlike any they had ever had before—a correspondence of
surprising honesty and depth in which they discussed their lives, the
things that matter to them, and what they still want to learn about each
other. Both a son’s love letter to his mother in her final years and an
unconventional mother’s life lessons for her grown son, The Rainbow Comes
and Goes offers a rare window into their close relationship and fascinating
lives. In these often hilarious and touching exchanges, they share their
most private thoughts and the hard-earned truths they’ve learned along the
way. Throughout, their distinctive personalities shine through—Anderson’s
darker outlook on the world is a brilliant contrast to his mother’s
idealism and unwavering optimism. An appealing blend of memoir and
inspirational advice, The Rainbow Comes and Goes is a beautiful and
affectionate celebration of the profound and universal bond between a
parent and child, and, like Tuesdays with Morrie, a thoughtful reflection
on life and love, reminding us of the precious knowledge and insight that
remains to be shared, no matter what age we are."

polygamist family. RUTH WARINER was the thirty-ninth of her father’s forty-
two children. Growing up on a farm in rural Mexico, where authorities turn
a blind eye to the practices of her community, Ruth lives in a ramshackle
house without indoor plumbing or electricity. At church, preachers teach
that God will punish the wicked by destroying the world and that women can
only ascend to Heaven by entering into polygamous marriages and giving
birth to as many children as possible. After Ruth’s father—the man who had
been the founding prophet of the colony—is brutally murdered by his brother
in a bid for church power, her mother remarries, becoming the second wife
of another faithful congregant. In need of government assistance and
supplemental income, Ruth and her siblings are carted back and forth
between Mexico and the United States, where Ruth’s mother collects welfare
and her stepfather works a variety of odd jobs. Ruth comes to love the time
she spends in the States, realizing that perhaps the community into which
she was born is not the right one for her. As she begins to doubt her
family’s beliefs and question her mother’s choices, she struggles to
balance her fierce love for her siblings with her determination to forge a
better life for herself. Recounted from the innocent and hopeful
perspective of a child, The Sound of Gravel is the remarkable memoir of one
girl’s fight for peace and love. This is an intimate, gripping tale of
triumph, courage, and resilience."

have outwitted and outfought everyone from Odin to Bacchus, but he’s about
to discover that what comes around when you go around messing with gods.
Six years into the training of his beautiful apprentice, Granuaile, a large
crow swoops down and transforms into none other than the Morrigan, a
goddess who insists that Atticus come with her at once. He must leave his
apprentice behind, along with his Irish wolfhound, Oberon—and he must also
leave his sword. The Morrigan has always taken extreme pleasure in
pronouncing the Druid’s mortal danger and imminent doom, so the fact that
she won’t reveal the purpose of their journey makes him very nervous. Of
course, any time the Celtic Chooser of the Slain drops in unannounced, it’s

She begins to make friends. And she begins to see that she may be the only

competitive running—and of athletic competition in general—and has become
one of the most beloved sports novels ever published.. Inspired by the
author’s experience as a collegiate champion, the story focuses on Quenton
Cassidy, a competitive runner at fictional Southeastern University whose
lifelong dream is to run a four-minute mile. He is less than a second away
when the turmoil of the Vietnam War era intrudes into the staid recesses of
his school’s athletic department. After he becomes involved in an athletes’
protest, Cassidy is suspended from his track team. Under the tutelage of
his friend and mentor, Bruce Denton, a graduate student and former Olympic
gold medalist, Cassidy gives up his scholarship, his girlfriend, and
possibly his future to withdraw to a monastic retreat in the countryside
and begin training for the race of his life against the greatest miler in
history. . A rare insider’s account of the incredibly intense lives of
elite distance runners, Once a Runner is an inspiring, funny, and spot-on

8413,8413,"On September 3, 2008 Alaska Governor Sarah Palin gave a speech at the
Republican National Convention that electrified the nation and instantly
made her one of the most recognizable women in the world. As chief
executive of America′s largest state, she had built a record as a reformer
who cast aside politics-as-usual and pushed through changes other
politicians only talked about: Energy independence. Ethics reform. And the
biggest private sector infrastructure project in U.S. history. While
revitalizing public school funding and ensuring the state met its
responsibilities to seniors and Alaska Native populations, Palin also beat
the political ""good ol′ boys club"" at their own game and brought Big Oil to
heel. Like her GOP running mate, John McCain, Palin wasn′t a packaged and
over-produced ""candidate."" She was a Main Street American woman: a working
mom, wife of a blue collar union man, and mother of five children, the
eldest of whom was serving his country in a yearlong deployment in Iraq and
the youngest, an infant with special needs. Palin′s hometown story touched
a populist nerve, rallying hundreds of thousands of ordinary Americans to
the GOP ticket. But as the campaign unfolded, Palin became a lightning rod
for both praise and criticism. Supporters called her ""refreshing,""
""honest,"" a kitchen-table public servant they felt would fight for their
interests. Opponents derided her as a wide-eyed Pollyanna unprepared for
national leadership. But none of them knew the real Sarah Palin. In this
eagerly anticipated memoir, Palin paints an intimate portrait of growing up
in the wilds of Alaska; meeting her lifelong love; her decision to enter
politics; the importance of faith and family; and the unique joys and
trials of life as a high-profile working mother. She also opens up for the
first time about the 2008 presidential race, providing a rare, mom′s-eye
view of high-stakes national politics - from patriots dedicated to ""Country
First"" to slick politicos bent on winning at any cost. Going Rogue traces
one ordinary citizen′s extraordinary journey, and imparts Palin′s vision of
a way forward for America and her unfailing hope in the greatest nation on
earth."

deserves—even if that means her body will reject the change, and begin to
die. Only the love of those closest to her can save her from the Darkness
in her spirit; but a terrible evil has emerged from the shadows, more
powerful than ever... Neferet has finally made herself known to mortals.
Crowning herself a Dark Goddess, she is evil unleashed and is enslaving the
citizens of Tulsa. The vampyres of the House of Night have banded with the
police, and are gathering every last resource they have, but they know that
no single vampyre is strong enough to vanquish her—unless that vampyre has
the power to summon the elements as well as the ability to wield Old
Magick. Only Zoey is heir to such power...but because of the consequences
of using Old Magick, she is unable to help. In the final novel in the House
of Night series, an epic battle of Light versus Darkness will decide who is
redeemed...and who is forever lost. The House of Night series by P.C. Cast
and Kristin Cast is an international phenomenon, reaching #1 on U.S.,
German, and UK bestseller lists, and remaining a fixture on The New York
Times Children's Series bestseller list for nearly 160 weeks and counting,

8658,8658,"Why are many of the most successful people plagued by feelings of emptiness
and alienation? This wise and profound book has provided thousands of
readers with an answer—and has helped them to apply it to their own
lives.Far too many of us had to learn as children to hide our own feelings,
needs, and memories skillfully in order to meet our parents’ expectations
and win their ”love.” Alice Miller writes, ”When I used the word ’gifted’
in the title, I had in mind neither children who receive high grades in
school nor children talented in a special way. I simply meant all of us who
have survived an abusive childhood thanks to an ability to adapt even to
unspeakable cruelty by becoming numb… Without this ’gift’ offered us by
nature, we would not have survived.” But merely surviving is not enough.
The Drama of the Gifted Child helps us to reclaim our life by discovering
our own crucial needs and our own truth."

practically everything around him, not only the books and paintings of high

For Barthes, words and objects have in common the organized capacity to say
something; at the same time, since they are signs, words and objects have
the bad faith always to appear natural to their consumer, as if what they
say is eternal, true, necessary, instead of arbitrary, made, contingent.
Mythologies finds Barthes revealing the fashioned systems of ideas that
make it possible, for example, for 'Einstein's brain' to stand for, be the
myth of, 'a genius so lacking in magic that one speaks about his thought as

8738,8738,"#1 NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER * The long-awaited first novel from the author
of Tenth of December: a moving and original father-son story featuring none
other than Abraham Lincoln, as well as an unforgettable cast of supporting
characters, living and dead, historical and invented February 1862. The
Civil War is less than one year old. The fighting has begun in earnest, and
the nation has begun to realize it is in for a long, bloody struggle.
Meanwhile, President Lincoln's beloved eleven-year-old son, Willie, lies
upstairs in the White House, gravely ill. In a matter of days, despite
predictions of a recovery, Willie dies and is laid to rest in a Georgetown
cemetery. ""My poor boy, he was too good for this earth,"" the president says
at the time. ""God has called him home."" Newspapers report that a grief-
stricken Lincoln returns, alone, to the crypt several times to hold his
boy's body. From that seed of historical truth, George Saunders spins an
unforgettable story of familial love and loss that breaks free of its
realistic, historical framework into a supernatural realm both hilarious
and terrifying. Willie Lincoln finds himself in a strange purgatory where
ghosts mingle, gripe, commiserate, quarrel, and enact bizarre acts of
penance. Within this transitional state--called, in the Tibetan tradition,
the bardo--a monumental struggle erupts over young Willie's soul. Lincoln
in the Bardo is an astonishing feat of imagination and a bold step forward
from one of the most important and influential writers of his generation.
Formally daring, generous in spirit, deeply concerned with matters of the
heart, it is a testament to fiction's ability to speak honestly and
powerfully to the things that really matter to us. Saunders has invented a
thrilling new form that deploys a kaleidoscopic, theatrical panorama of
voices to ask a timeless, profound question: How do we live and love when
we know that everything we love must end? Praise for Lincoln in the Bardo
""A luminous feat of generosity and humanism.""--Colson Whitehead, The New
York Times Book Review ""A masterpiece.""--Zadie Smith ""Ingenious . . .
Saunders--well on his way toward becoming a twenty-first-century Twain--
crafts an American patchwork of love and loss, giving shape to our
foundational sorrows.""--Vogue ""Saunders is the most humane American writer
working today.""--Harper's Magazine ""The novel beats with a present-day
urgency--a nation at war with itself, the unbearable grief of a father who
has lost a child, and a howling congregation of ghosts, as divided in death
as in life, unwilling to move on.""--Vanity Fair ""A brilliant, Buddhist
reimagining of an American story of great loss and great love.""--Elle
""Wildly imaginative""--Marie Claire ""Mesmerizing . . . Dantesque . . . A
haunting American ballad.""--Publishers Weekly (starred review)
""Exhilarating . . . Ruthless and relentless in its evocation not only of
Lincoln and his quandary, but also of the tenuous existential state shared
by all of us."" --Kirkus Reviews (starred review) ""It's unlike anything
you've ever read, except that the grotesque humor, pathos, and, ultimately,
human kindness at its core mark it as a work that could come only from
Saunders.""--The National"

conflict was shaped to a remarkable degree by a small handful of

At the center of it all was Lawrence himself. In early 1914 he was an
archaeologist excavating ruins in Syria; by 1917 he was riding into legend
at the head of an Arab army as he fought a rearguard action against his own

Jelucan, where aristocratic Thane Kyrell and rural villager Ciena Ree bond
over their love of flying. Enrolling at the Imperial Academy is nothing
less than a dream come true for both of them. But Thane sours on the dream
when he sees firsthand the horrific tactics the Empire uses to maintain its
ironclad rule. Bitter and disillusioned, he joins the fledgling Rebellion--
putting Ciena in an unbearable position between her loyalty to the Empire

9021,9021,"Winner of the 1999 Pulitzer Prize for Drama, the New York Drama Critics
Circle Award, the Drama Desk Award, the Outer Critics Circle Award, the
Lucille Lortel Award, and the Oppenheimer Award Margaret Edson's powerfully
imagined Pulitzer Prize–winning play examines what makes life worth living
through her exploration of one of existence's unifying
experiences—mortality—while she also probes the vital importance of human
relationships. What we as her audience take away from this remarkable drama
is a keener sense that, while death is real and unavoidable, our lives are
ours to cherish or throw away—a lesson that can be both uplifting and
redemptive. As the playwright herself puts it, ""The play is not about
doctors or even about cancer. It's about kindness, but it shows arrogance.
It's about compassion, but it shows insensitivity."" In Wit, Edson delves
into timeless questions with no final answers: How should we live our lives
knowing that we will die? Is the way we live our lives and interact with
others more important than what we achieve materially, professionally, or
intellectually? How does language figure into our lives? Can science and
art help us conquer death, or our fear of it? What will seem most important
to each of us about life as that life comes to an end? The immediacy of the
presentation, and the clarity and elegance of Edson's writing, make this
sophisticated, multilayered play accessible to almost any interested
reader. As the play begins, Vivian Bearing, a renowned professor of English
who has spent years studying and teaching the intricate, difficult Holy
Sonnets of the seventeenth-century poet John Donne, is diagnosed with
advanced ovarian cancer. Confident of her ability to stay in control of
events, she brings to her illness the same intensely rational and
painstakingly methodical approach that has guided her stellar academic
career. But as her disease and its excruciatingly painful treatment
inexorably progress, she begins to question the single-minded values and
standards that have always directed her, finally coming to understand the
aspects of life that make it truly worth living."

classic Dune universe, ranging from the time of the Butlerian Jihad to the
original Dune series and beyond. Based directly on Frank Herbert's final
outline, which lay hidden in a safe-deposit box for a decade, these two
volumes will finally answer the urgent questions Dune fans have been
debating for two decades. At the end of Chapterhouse: Dune--Frank Herbert's
final novel--a ship carrying the ghola of Duncan Idaho, Sheeana (a young
woman who can control sandworms), and a crew of various refugees escapes
into the uncharted galaxy, fleeing from the monstrous Honored Matres, dark

Matres have swarmed into the known universe, driven from their home by a
terrifying, mysterious Enemy. As designed by the creative genius of Frank
Herbert, the primary story of Hunters and Sandworms is the exotic odyssey
of Duncan's no-ship as it is forced to elude the diabolical traps set by
the ferocious, unknown Enemy. To strengthen their forces, the fugitives
have used genetic technology from Scytale, the last Tleilaxu Master, to
revive key figures from Dune's past--including Paul Muad'Dib and his
beloved Chani, Lady Jessica, Stilgar, Thufir Hawat, and even Dr. Wellington

a loyal neighbor, and a Zen commuter. She is not: a cook, a craftswoman, a
decorator, an active PTA member, a natural caretaker, or the breadwinner.
But when her husband makes a radical career change, Alice is ready to lean
in--and she knows exactly how lucky she is to land a job at Scroll, a hip
young start-up which promises to be the future of reading, with its chain
of chic literary lounges and dedication to beloved classics. The Holy Grail
of working mothers--an intellectually satisfying job and a happy personal
life--seems suddenly within reach. Despite the disapproval of her best
friend, who owns the local bookstore, Alice is proud of her new ""balancing
act"" (which is more like a three-ring circus) until her dad gets sick, her
marriage flounders, her babysitter gets fed up, her kids start to grow up,
and her work takes an unexpected turn. Fans of I Don't Know How She Does
It, Where'd You Go Bernadette, and The Storied Life of A.J. Fikry will
cheer as Alice realizes the question is not whether it's possible to have
it all, but what does she--Alice Pearse--really want?""--"

marks a major new contribution to the story of the American family. The
Turners have lived on Yarrow Street for over fifty years. Their house has
seen thirteen children grown and gone—and some returned; it has seen the
arrival of grandchildren, the fall of Detroit’s East Side, and the loss of
a father. The house still stands despite abandoned lots, an embattled city,
and the inevitable shift outward to the suburbs. But now, as ailing
matriarch Viola finds herself forced to leave her home and move in with her
eldest son, the family discovers that the house is worth just a tenth of
its mortgage. The Turner children are called home to decide its fate and to
reckon with how each of their pasts haunts—and shapes—their family’s
future. Praised by Ayana Mathis as “utterly moving” and “un-putdownable,”
The Turner House brings us a colorful, complicated brood full of love and
pride, sacrifice and unlikely inheritances. It’s a striking examination of
the price we pay for our dreams and futures, and the ways in which our
families bring us home."

likely we are to cheat? How do companies pave the way for dishonesty? Does
collaboration make us more or less honest? Does religion improve our
honesty? Most of us think of ourselves as honest, but, in fact, we all
cheat. From Washington to Wall Street, the classroom to the workplace,
unethical behavior is everywhere. None of us is immune, whether it's a
white lie to head off trouble or padding our expense reports. In The

Ariely shows why some things are easier to lie about than others; how
getting caught matters less than we think in whether we cheat; and how
business practices pave the way for unethical behavior, both intentionally

personal, professional, and political worlds, and how it affects all of us,
even as we think of ourselves as having high moral standards. But all is

achieving higher ethics in our everyday lives. With compelling personal and

the dark side of pink and pretty: the rise of the girlie-girl, she warns,
is not that innocent. Sweet and sassy or predatory and hardened, sexualized
girlhood influences our daughters from infancy onward, telling them that
how a girl looks matters more than who she is. Somewhere between the
exhilarating rise of Girl Power in the 1990s and today, the pursuit of
physical perfection has been recast as the source of female empowerment.
And commercialization has spread the message faster and farther, reaching
girls at ever-younger ages. But how dangerous is pink and pretty, anyway?
Being a princess is just make-believe; eventually they grow out of it . . .
or do they? In search of answers, Peggy Orenstein visited Disneyland,
trolled American Girl Place, and met parents of beauty-pageant preschoolers
tricked out like Vegas showgirls. The stakes turn out to be higher than she

rising rates of narcissism, the potential negative impact of this new
girlie-girl culture is undeniable—yet armed with awareness and recognition,
parents can effectively counterbalance its influence in their daughters'
lives."
