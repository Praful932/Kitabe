1. The Project works seamlessly on Python version `3.8.6`

3. Clone Your Forked copy/the original repo - `git clone https://github.com/[YOUR-USERNAME]/Kitabe.git`

4.  Navigate to the directory of project -  `cd Kitabe/`


5. (Optional) If you're intending to raise an MR else you can skip this step, Create a new branch -  `git checkout -b [branch_name]`

6. Install requirements from [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation) - `poetry install`
    - If you prefer the vanilla route `poetry export -f requirements.txt --output requirements.txt --without-hashes` skip to step (8)


7. Activate the environment -  `poetry shell`

8. Open `BookRecSystem/settings.py`

9. Make Migrations - `python manage.py migrate`
